He glanced at me several times these past weeks as I brought dinner to the table or poured the wine. He just smiles and looks into my eyes. Like I'm an equal. Not as if I were a young woman merely there to refill his flagon or clear away the dirty dishes, but as someone he might actually be interested in. I don't know what to think of it. I'm probably just imagining it, dreaming about what life would be like if I didn't have to serve and clean every day. It's a dream, but I can hope that it comes true. Can't I?"
"\n"
"\nI wasn't imagining things! Tonight in the hallway, Lord Maurice pulled me aside. He asked if I was married. If I had a family. Speechless would be a good word for my reaction. He's so—what's the word I'm looking for? Kind? Different? His father and mother beat me repeatedly for simple transgressions. But their son isn't like that. He's so nice. I'm still having a difficult time believing it. He wants to see me again. Alone. I'm not sure what to think about all this."
"\n"
"\nLord Maurice came to me again. He said he wanted to tell me something. He took my hand and led me off into the night. Hand in hand, we snuck through the gardens and sat on a bench beneath the moons. The way he looked at me sent shivers down my spine. "

But really, I know the truth. They are little more than smugglers and sea-raiders propping up their criminal activities behind a facade of ideals. They lie! And they shall pay!"

They are smugglers and pirates and thieves to the last filthy cat."

"\nThe Renrijra are swaggering fools. Do you know what the so-called ""code"" of their order is called? ""The Foolish Concepts."" Fools! I have intercepted their logs and records, and I know their ways. They kill without hesitation. They espouse bravery, yet run away when confronted with justice. They curry favor by giving trinkets to the poor. Then they claim to be benefactors when stealing from those of privilege. A thief is still a thief!"

It's dark down here, but not so dark that I need a candle to see. These old blue stones glow and hum softly. Even though it's nothing but cold, wet stone, there is something almost inviting about this place. I have decided to call it Husul's Cave. I can't wait to explore it more thoroughly. I already noticed some old books just waiting to be read."

If only she were flesh and blood … I would make her mine."

All I know is this vessel needs to have some magic in its blood. I started to despair, but then I remembered my wife. My Adeena. She's always had something in her. Something magical.

"\nAnurraame was careful at first to keep her affair a secret, lest she shame her husband. But caught up in passion's capricious winds, she became more and more reckless, and soon her dalliance was discovered."
"\n"
"\nSpurned and infuriated, Anurraame's husband arrayed his full army before Erokii and laid siege to the city. The princess vowed to face him with fortitude and called on her lover to muster his forces in defense of the city, which he promised he would."
"\n"
"\nBut when the day of battle came, her lover's forces appeared beside her husband's. His undying passion had been subverted by coin."
"\n"
"\nDesperate and enraged at her lover's betrayal, Anurraame called on the Daedra for help destroying her enemies and defending her city. Mephala answered and commanded Anurraame to pour all her tears into a basin. Mephala then imbued the tears with the power of the princess's hatred for her traitorous lover, hatred which had formed from the potent seed of the princess's love."
"\n"
"\nThe tears, so empowered, hardened into an artifact, the Tear of Anurraame. When the time of battle came, Anurraame took the artifact to the highest tower of the city and as the armies raged outside the city's walls, she unleashed its power, destroying the armies and the city in the flash of an eye."
"\n"
"\nAll that remains of Erokii, and of Anurraame herself, is a ruined crypt, but there have been whispers throughout the ages that the Tear was not destroyed, and that it's waiting in the rubble, still to be found."
