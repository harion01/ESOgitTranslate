"My research indicates that these hills hide the Midnight Talisman, a relic I believe is the key to defeating Angof. And my further investigations have enabled me to determine the exact hiding place.\n"
"\n"
"I know that Commander Marone won't like it, but this opportunity is too good to let pass. I need to retrieve the talisman. There's no time to waste.\n"
"\n"
"I believe that the crypt within the cliff face to the north of our camp serves as the talisman's final resting place. Unfortunately, our camp is under assault. Undead creatures relentlessly attack us from all sides. The Lion Guard soldiers grow weary with each assault they repel. I'll order them to return to the redoubt in the morning. If we make it to the morning. \n"
"\n"
"Then I'll head for that cave to the north."

"Young Prince Anton inherits the throne of his father this day. Queen Sylvie will stand by his side as he ascends for his coronation. The roasts and the cakes are prepared to my direction. I am proud of the servants. I cannot tell which dishes I cooked anymore and everything will be ready precisely on time.\n"
"\n"
"The young Prince came down last night and requested my longfin stew for tonight's banquet. This old palace chef has never been so honored.\n"
"\n"
"18 Hearthfire, 2E 401\n"
"\n"
"I endured the tongue-lashing of Queen Sylvie for my \"scandalous dish\" in front of my staff. Little Gloria asked me why I didn't speak up and tell the Queen that King Anton requested it personally. She is, of course, so young. She cannot possibly understand. One does not speak up against their betters.\n"
"\n"
"King Anton came down an hour later and thanked me personally for the meal. He will make a good king.\n"
"\n"
"11 Rain's Hand, 2E 408\n"
"\n"
"Queen Sylvie passed away this evening. She expired peacefully in her sleep. I berated the staff, who believed that cooking a meal for the ailing Queen tonight would be a waste of food. Still, I did not make them cook. Food should never be prepared with spite.\n"
"\n"
"Instead, I went to the ailing Queen and asked what I could make for her. I could see that she knew she would not make it through the night. But she smiled faintly and humored me. She asked for my longfin stew.\n"
"\n"
"27 Second Seed, 2E 409\n"
"\n"
"King Anton has survived the poisoned darts of the assassins. The staff has worked diligently to prepare the most healthful food to help speed his recovery. I caught Gloria slipping potions of fortitude and health into his soup. I gave her the gold I earned for the week. She will make an excellent chef one day. After I am no longer around, of course.\n"
"\n"
"14 Sun's Height, 2E 409\n"
"\n"
"King Anton recovered fully. His first action was to hold a funeral for his Seneschal, the loyal servant who took the brunt of the assassins' cowardly attack. \n"
"\n"
"Gossip in the kitchen revolves around who is to be the next Seneschal. Gloria said it should be me. What nonsense.\n"
"\n"
"19 Sun's Height, 2E 409\n"
"\n"
"Gloria will have to prove her mettle in the kitchen sooner than I thought. King Anton has asked me to be the next Seneschal. I told him I knew nothing of the position. He replied that that was why he wanted me to take the job.\n"
"\n"
"I suspect there is much the King is not telling me, but it is not my place to question his wisdom.\n"
"\n"
"30 Frostfall, 2E 414\n"
"\n"
"I recently rediscovered this journal. How very quaint it is, and so full of memories. I thought it would be amusing to write in it again. It seems so long since I was just the palace chef.\n"
"\n"
"Gloria, my dear wife, has taken to the task better than I could have hoped. The servants look up to her, and she is proud of them each and every day. I understand the King's wisdom now. How he knew I would rise to this task I might never understand. I bow to his wisdom now as I did then.\n"
"\n"
"22 Sun's Dawn, 2E 425\n"
"\n"
"This old book has endured much. As I lie in this bed, coughing from poison, it brings me a small amount of joy. Gloria lies nearby. If I could will my strength into her I would. I slew the spy who poisoned the King's food myself, before I succumbed, but not before Gloria ate her fill.\n"
"\n"
"King Anton is unharmed, but Gloria ….\n"
"\n"
"7 First Seed, 2E 425\n"
"\n"
"Gloria went to her final sleep in the night. One of the servants brought us dinner, not knowing what was to come. I didn't know Gloria had taught the servants how to prepare my longfin stew.\n"
"\n"
"In the morning, the servant came and apologized for the crass meal. I told her it was all right. Longfin stew is a meal fit for a queen.\n"
"\n"
"29 Rain's Hand, 2E 430\n"
"\n"
"The shakes took me today and I fell. I am not so old that my own legs should fail me. Damn the effects of this poison! At least I found this book under the bed.\n"
"\n"
"King Anton wants to try some Ayleid magic to heal me. His wisdom, as always, is beyond mine. The new Seneschal serves him well, but still he looks after this old man.\n"
"\n"
"12 Last Seed, 2E 431\n"
"\n"
"I think I died today. It is difficult to say. I can walk around and speak, but there is a detached feeling. I can feel the crown I am bound to, sitting in its chest, and the servant who watches me raise the pen and write these words looks at me fearfully.\n"
"\n"
"I still serve my King, even in this spirit form. I do not tire and I possess a form so much closer to my younger self. I can serve until my King's bones turn to dust. And so I shall.\n"
"\n"
"11 Hearthfire, 2E 450\n"
"\n"
"The King passed away today and will be sealed in a tomb. I am to be his guardian. I could do with the solitude. The servants fear me and to be frank their company doesn't do that much for me, either.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"\n"
"Time has passed in the tomb and my inkwell runs dry. I am bound to the crown, buried with my once-King. His bones crumble, but still I serve. What use am I, serving in this hollow place? Was my King's wisdom so infallible, or did I just blindly believe in it?"

"Something definitely went wrong with the portal spell. Instead of arriving in Coldharbour as an invading force to be reckoned with, we wound up scattered to the four winds. I am now a captain without a command. The others that appeared with me—we've been fighting or running since we got here. We finally found a relatively safe spot on the edge of a dark forest and decided to set up camp. This is the first time since we arrived that I've felt safe enough to just sit down and record my thoughts.\n"
"\n"
"Time seems to flow differently in this realm. Sometimes it feel like we've only been here for a few hours and other times I could swear we've been here for days. This mission has turned into a colossal failure. Instead of stepping through the portal together, we were thrown in all directions, strewn about like so many dry leaves in a bitter wind. Luck was with me, though. I landed in the company of Kamu the Khajiit. If only the rest of my luck had turned out as well.\n"
"\n"
"We found ourselves in a strange ruin east of this camp. There were cold flame atronachs everywhere, intent on roasting us to a very fine blue crisp. We dispatched a couple of the creatures before we were forced to turn tail and run. For some reason, however, as we got close to the forest, the atronachs stopped chasing us. They suddenly seemed to lose interest in us and returned to the ruin.\n"
"\n"
"Well, I guess I should stop writing now and help finish setting up our camp. I'll write more after we get some sleep, provided nothing terrible happens to us in the interim.\n"
"\n"
"***\n"
"\n"
"We were awakened after a few hours (minutes? days?) of sleep by voices. There seem to be people in the shadows of the woods, talking, whispering. We can hear them, but the voices aren't distinct enough to make out any actual words. Or maybe it's just a language that none of us have ever heard before. I'm not sure. Every so often, though, we clearly hear something that sounds like a cry for help.\n"
"\n"
"Every time we hear that desperate cry, we think of our missing allies. It could be some of them, lost out in those dark woods. They might be hurt, or in danger, or—well, anything could be happening in there! Kamu and I have decided to head into the forest and find the source of those pitiful cries.\n"
"\n"
"I'm going to leave my journal here, in case any other members of our expedition come across this camp. We'll try to leave a trail so that you can follow our path. We're going to head west and then southwest, so follow after us if you can.\n"
"\n"
"Here's something else you need to know. Kamu discovered that if you touch one of the wisps that float among the trees, you glow and get a temporary source of light—perfect for finding your way through these shadowy woods. I suggest you make liberal use of the wisps if you're going to try to meet up with us.\n"
"\n"
"Well, it's time to go. I hope to see you soon. And may the Eight watch over us all."

"Other ships followed us through the fog. One by one they emerged. Some were battered, some were missing, but many remained. We formed up and sailed toward the main island.\n"
"\n"
"Through the terrible storms that battered us on our way, the captain stood firm. Many in the crew wished to abandon our cause, but the captain cursed them and would not hear of it. His cabin is directly above mine and at night I swear I could hear demonic whispers and see eerie lights. The captain I knew slipped away in the fog to be replaced by spectre of anger and hate.\n"
"\n"
"A projection of Baron-Admiral Olo appeared on our deck. He spoke as if he could not see us—I assume this was some sort of magical broadcast to the fleet. He ordered us to take boats and men to sack the big island and lay siege to the tower by land as his remaining Imperial ships bombarded it from a distance. We armed ourselves with swords and bows, and the captain ordered us to the longboats. \n"
"\n"
"When we set foot on shore I think we were the first to arrive. We were not the last. The Sloads are powerful necromancers, but they are poor hand-to-hand fighters and our numbers dwarfed theirs. Still, they fought, and they died as we conquered their island. They whispered curses to their Daedric Lord with their dying breaths are we took their gold, their goods, and their lives. \n"
"\n"
"The blue light atop the coral tower began to pulse and bleed energy into the clouded sky. When the ground beneath our feet began to quake and tremble, no one had to tell us to run. The island began to crack and sink. The sea around Thras boiled as we rowed for our lives back to the Golden Era. \n"
"\n"
"We were hauled back on deck in time to watch the Coral Tower collapse into the sea. We noticed too late the current that pulled us towards it. As the eye of blue light atop the tower dipped into the sea it began to spin like a great wheel, and when it met the waves it formed a monstrous whirlpool. Half the fleet was drawn into it, our ship included."

"남작-제독 올로의 형상이 우리 갑판 위에 떠올랐다. 그는 우리를 보지 못하는 것처럼 말했는데, 아마 함대를 향한 마법적 방송 같은 것이었다고 추측된다. 그는 큰 섬을 함락시키기 위해 보트에 선원들을 싣고 상륙하고 나머지 제국 함선들이 원거리에서 포격하는 동안 탑을 공격하도록 명령했다. 우리는 검과 활로 무장했고, 선장은 우리에게 대형 보트에 탑승하라 명령했다.\n"

"For two days we have been wracked by storms more foul and terrible than any I have ever seen. They seem to grow worse as we approach Thras. The crew talks of terrible whispers on the air and glimpses of rotting things moving in the water. I myself have been too sick to see or hear anything other than my own illness.

"I remember thinking, as we slid into the massive whirlpool, that my mates and I would never see Alten Corimont again. I was right, but not in the way I thought. The truth was even worse.\n"
"\n"
"As we were sucked into the pulsing blue light beneath the maelstrom, I felt water rush over my scales. Before the sea could consume me, a gale of cold wind exploded from below. We were no longer sinking—we were falling! As I clung to the deck, I saw that the whirling wall of water had been replaced by a dark, haunted sky and an infinite expanse of cold, dead earth. And it was rushing to meet us as we fell.\n"
"\n"
"I blacked out, waking up some time later on the deck. I remember seeing the Captain talking to what appeared to be a great beast. I remember the beast handing the Captain something and then I blacked out again.\n"
"\n"
"When I awoke, I was transformed. My scales and skin were gone—I was nought but bones. The Captain was now the Admiral, and whatever he commanded we could not refuse. More ships fell from the sky, and our Lost Fleet grew. We put the Era back together, dug tunnels, and constructed a town from the wreckage of the other ships, all at the Admiral's command.\n"
"\n"
"We hate him, but we cannot disobey him. It's that crown he wears. I pray that one day someone who can resist the Admiral finds this journal. This journal, and the key I have hidden within its pages."

"우리가 고동치는 푸른 빛 아래에서 엄청난 소용돌이에 빨려들 때, 난 물이 내 비늘에 몰려드는 것을 느꼈다. 바다가 나를 삼켜버리기 전에, 차가운 강풍이 아래에서 터져나왔다. 우리는 더 이상 가라앉지 않고 있었다. 우리는 추락하고 있었다! 갑판에 매달려 있는 동안 나는 소용돌이치는 물로 이루어진 벽이 어둡고 불안한 하늘,  무한한 넓이의 추위와 죽음의 땅으로 대체된 것을 보았다. 그리고 그것이 우리를 만나러 빠르게 달려들고 있었다.\n"

"\n"
"내가 깨어났을 때, 난 변해 있었다. 내 비늘과 피부는 사라졌다. 뼈만이 남아있을 뿐이었다. 선장은 이제 제독이 되었고, 놈의 명령이 무엇이건 우리는 거부할 수가 없다. 더 많은 배들이 하늘에서 떨어졌고, 우리 잃어버린 함대는 커져갔다. 우리는 제독의 명령에 따라 함께 시대 호를 자리에 갖다 놓고, 굴을 파고 다른 배들의 잔해를 이용해 마을을 건설했다.\n"
"\n"
"우리는 놈을 증오하지만, 놈에게 거역할 수가 없다. 놈이 쓴 그 왕관 때문이다. 언젠가 제독에게 저항할 수 있는 누군가가 나타나서 이 일지를 찾아내길 빈다. 이 일지, 그리고 그 안에 숨겨둔 열쇠를 말이다."

"This year, as we get closer to the start of classes here at Shad Astula, I look forward to finding excellent leadership candidates among this year's crop of students. Those who will grow into great leaders, remarkable scholars, and mighty warriors for the Houses of Morrowind. And, starting this season, for the entire Ebonheart Pact, as well. Often, my visions don't manifest until a student has spent some time within the Academy. Most years, no one emerges who quite matches my hopes and dreams.\n"
"\n"
"Which is why I was encouraged, confused, and a bit frightened when I started receiving visions of three students who haven't even arrived at the Academy yet. At first, I worried that my visions were faulty. But this is not the case. These visions are as clear as any I've ever experienced, albeit with dark undertones I do not yet understand.\n"
"\n"
"My first vision concerned Tedras Relvi. A noble son of House Indoril, his entire life has involved magic. His father is a battlemage, his mother a healer. Pompous and a bit of a whiny brat, Tedras is lazy and hard-headed. He's also a master of word and wit. In fact, I think he might make a better bard than a wizard. Still, I must heed my visions. From what I've seen, his future self grows into a master negotiator.\n"
"\n"
"Hadmar the Thin-Boned was the subject of my second vision. It's rare for me to see a Nord in a vision, and rarer still that a Nord develops significant magical talent. With a pure heart and a warrior's spirit, Hadmar possesses a good soul. He's also dumb as a guar. Will he embrace his magical studies? Regardless, I see him standing tall upon the field of battle. Does he have the makings of a battlemage, perhaps?\n"
"\n"
"The final vision concerned Lena Dalvel, and it was the most confusing of the three. Her lineage contains almost no magical heritage. In fact, I'm not sure how she got an invitation to our school—perhaps a House noble recognized her talent? Her vision is the most promising—and the most frightening. Lena stands on a balance that could easily tip toward the darkness or the light, two possible paths for her to walk. One path shows her as a great leader of the people, serving in a coming time of troubles. The other path shows her involvement in the destruction of the world. This particular vision disturbs me greatly, and it must not be allowed to come to pass. She must finish her trials under my guidance. It's imperative that her proper destiny be fulfilled."

"6. Falinesti. I've heard rumors that the city has vanished, but the sites where it lived for the four seasons are still large attractions. \n"

I finally have a way to make the Argonians pay. I just need to ingratiate myself with the Mercius sisters and become a trusted member of their fledgling society, Cyrodilic Collections.

I applaud Concordia Mercius and her meticulous analysis of historic documents and local legends. Soon, the Xal-Toh of Norg-Tzel will be mine, and that will lead me to the real prize!\n"

I know what I'm talking about. After all, I barely survived my two treks through the swamps of Murkmire. Various tribes of lizards hunted me, killed my companions, and left me for dead when I simply tried to negotiate with them. The hateful creatures! Why wouldn't they leave me alone? And why did the Dead-Water warriors have to kill my beloved son? He was just trying to protect me!\n"

Six days later I was in Belkarth, but that was still too close. That's where the dreams started. Hitched a ride with a westbound Dragonstar caravan.

Got blind drunk, we did, and the hangover was worth it, because that night I didn't get the dream. And the same trick worked every night since then—until last night.

"I take quill to paper to record what I fear are the final days of Hackdirt. Though many would despise this place as a backwater of no value, I have found peace here. Few of the more \"civilized\" places I have lived have made me feel as welcome. Though few of my race have ever come here, I encountered no prejudice, no resentment.\n"
"\n"
"For two years I lived here, enjoying friendship and trust as never before. This has been a golden time in my long life, one I will deeply regret if it comes to an end.\n"
"\n"
"Several weeks ago, a human of rough looks and worse manners strolled into the village. He marched about as if he owned the place, opening every unlocked door, peering into every stable. Ovidius, usually the most pompous of swollen fools, for once acted as the prefect he claims to be. He confronted this stranger, demanding to know his business here.\n"
"\n"
"The intruder stared at him rudely and didn't deign to answer. He strode from the village and vanished beyond the hills to the east. Etiache wanted to follow him, but Ovidius forbade it, worried that only trouble would result.\n"
"\n"
"If only we had listened to Etiache. We should have caught and killed that stranger. Perhaps what befell us would have been avoided. Auri-El knows; I do not.\n"
"\n"
"A few days later, another stranger came to Hackdirt, wearing well-used swords loose in their scabbards. His steed was wild-eyed, a warhorse bred for combat, held in check only by the rider's stern hand. Up to Ovidius this warrior rode.\n"
"\n"
"He named himself Vanier and proclaimed himself the new overlord of Hackdirt. He said his gang, the Black Daggers, waited just over the hill. He gave us one day to agree to his terms or all would be slaughtered. All inhabitants were now his servants and our dwellings, livestock, and all possessions were now his. Those who cooperated would find him a just overlord, he claimed.\n"
"\n"
"Ovidius stared, mouth agape. Before he could gather his wits, matters were taken from his hands. Nerva charged Vanier, screaming that he would never live as a slave. The bandit's sword sheared off the tines of Nerva's pitchfork and the horse's hooves lashed out and crushed his head. We stood there stunned as Vanier rode off.\n"
"\n"
"We buried Nerva behind his house that evening. Then we gathered around the well and discussed our fate. Some, like Yggoz and Etiache, urged that we stay and fight. As if farmers and merchants had a chance against such as Vanier. Saner heads prevailed and we voted to abandon Hackdirt. Even Yggoz agreed in the end.\n"
"\n"
"Only Ovidius opposed the will of the rest, saying he would never leave Hackdirt. No argument could prevail against him. In the end, he ascended the tower with all the food and water we could spare. We sealed the door shut behind him.\n"
"\n"
"It was Iirenir, quiet, shy Iirenir, who suggested we chain shut our doors and destroy all we could not carry. This was done with a sense of grim satisfaction.\n"

"내가 마지막이 될까 두려워하는 해크더트에서의 날들을 기록하기 위하여 이 깃펜을 잡는다. 많은 이들이 이곳을 별볼일없는 벽지라며 무시하지만, 나는 바로 이곳에서 평화를 찾았다. 내가 예전에 살던 더 \"문명화된\" 몇몇 장소에서는 이렇게 환영받는 느낌을 받지 못했었다. 내 종족이 여기에 발을 들여놓았던 적은 거의 없었지만, 난 어떤 편견도, 어떤 분노도 맞닥뜨리지 않았다.\n"
"\n"
"내가 여기서 살았던 2년 동안, 전에는 결코 겪어보지 못했던 우정과 신뢰를 즐길 수 있었다. 이것은 내 오랜 인생의 황금기였으며, 이 생활에 끝이 온다면 난 깊은 유감을 느낄 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"몇 주 전, 거칠어보이는 외모와 그보다 더 나쁜 태도를 가진 인간이 마을에 어슬렁대며 들어왔다. 그는 자기가 여길 소유한 것 마냥 으스대며 걸어오더니, 잠기지 않은 문이란 문은 전부 열어젖히고, 모든 마구간을 유심히 쳐다보았다. 평소에 가장 젠체하던 오비디우스가 이번만큼은 자기가 떠들어대던 말을 완벽하게 행동으로 보여 주었다. 그 이방인에게 맞서서 무슨 일로 여기 왔는지를 밝히라고 요구한 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"불청객은 오비디우스를 무례하게 노려보며 대답을 하지 않았다. 그는 마을에서 성큼성큼 걸어나가 언덕을 넘어 동쪽으로 사라져 갔다. 에티아체는 불청객을 따라가길 원했지만, 오비디우스가 그러지 못하게 했다. 문제만 일으킬 것을 염려했기 때문이었다.\n"
"\n"
"우리가 에티아체의 말을 듣기만 했더라면. 그 이방인을 붙잡아 죽였어야 했다. 그렇게 했으면 우리가 처한 상황을 피할 수 있었을지도 모른다. 아우리-엘께서는 아시겠지. 난 모르겠다.\n"
"\n"
"며칠이 지나자, 다른 이방인이 해크더트에 찾아왔다. 오래 사용한 듯 보이는 검을 칼집에 느슨하게 집어넣은 채였다. 그가 타고 있던 말은 전투를 위해 사육되어 분노에 찬 눈을 가진 군마였으며, 오직 기수의 엄중한 손에 의해서만 통제되고 있었다. 이 전사는 오비디우스에게 말을 타고 다가갔다.\n"
"\n"
"그는 자신을 바니어라고 밝히고는 자신이 해크더트의 새로운 지배자라고 선언했다. 그의 말로는 자신의 조직 검은 단검단이 언덕 바로 너머에서 기다리고 있다는 것이었다. 그는 우리에게 자신의 조건에 동의할 하루의 시간을 주고는, 동의하지 않으면 우릴 학살하겠다고 말했다. 모든 주민들은 이제 자신의 하인이며 우리의 주택, 가축, 그리고 모든 소유물은 이제 자신의 것이라는 요구였다. 협력하는 자들은 자신을 지배자로 섬기게 된다는 것이었다.\n"
"\n"
"오비디우스는 입을 딱 벌리고 바니어를 빤히 쳐다보았다. 오비디우스가 생각을 정리하기도 전에, 이 문제는 그의 손을 떠나 버렸다. 넬바가 노예로 살 수는 없다고 외치면서 바니어에게 달려든 것이다. 도적놈의 검이 넬바가 들고 있던 쇠스랑의 머리 부분을 잘라내 버렸고, 말발굽이 넬바의 머리를 부숴 버렸다. 우리는 바니어가 말을 타고 떠나갈 때까지 충격을 받아 그 자리에 서 있었다.\n"
"\n"
"우리는 그날 저녁에 넬바를 그의 집 뒷편에 묻어 주었다. 그리고는 함께 우물 근처에 모여 우리의 운명에 대해 논의해 봤다. 이고즈와 에티아체같은 몇몇은 우리가 남아서 싸워야 한다고 주장했다. 마치 농부와 상인들이 바니어같은 자와 맞서 이길 가능성이 있다는 듯이 말이다. 더 분별력있었던 사람들이 이겼고, 우리는 해크더트를 버리기로 결정했다. 결국에는 이고즈마저 동의했다.\n"
"\n"
"오직 오비디우스만이 나머지의 의견을 반대하며 해크더트를 절대로 떠나지 않겠다고 말했다. 어떤 논쟁도 그의 생각을 꺾지 못했다. 결국 그는 우리가 나누어줄 수 있었던 음식과 물을 전부 가지고 탑으로 올라갔다. 우리는 그의 등 뒤로 문을 봉인했다.\n"
"\n"
"우리의 문을 쇠사슬로 걸어 잠그고 가져갈 수 없는 것들은 모조리 파괴하자고 제안했던 사람은 바로 이레니어였다. 그 조용하고 수줍음 많은 이레니어가 말이다. 그 제안은 쓰라린 만족감과 함께 완수되었다.\n"
"\n"
"곧 동이 틀 것이다. 다른 이들은 이미 출발하여 느리게 남쪽으로 가고 있다. 나도 떠나야 한다. 난 이 일지를 마무리하기 위해 남아있었을 뿐이다. 어쩌면 언젠가는 우리가 해크더트를 되찾아서 이 일지가 우리의 가장 어두웠던 시기에 대한 기록으로써 살아남게 될지도 모르겠다."

"The Ra Gada were no more than a comparatively new and invasive people, who began their residence upon the shores of Tamriel only after rendering their homeland irreparably damaged.

"After many months, my beloved grows weaker and I feel more and more powerless. The Guild Mages say there is nothing that can be done, but I refuse to believe it. They simply lack creativity and the will to save her. I possess both.\n"

"My initial experiments into reviving dead flesh show promise. I am hopeful that soon I will have discovered a method to reverse this necrotic disease that afflicts my beloved….\n"
"\n"
"Second and Final Entry:\n"
"\n"
"My beloved died today. The Guild Mages came to confront me. For the first time since my beloved fell ill, I saw the monstrosities I had created in my single-minded effort to save her. The people of this city look at me ruefully, like I am some kind of monster myself.\n"

"Mercifully, the Guild Mages have offered me a place with the Thalmor in Woodhearth, far away from these memories and my terrible mistakes. A new start will be good, I think."

"But to my Lord, our family tragedy was too great to bear. He has it in his thick Skull that he can somehow overcome death—not for the sake of knowledge, or to command fearless forces to defend our home—but to tear the once-living back into this realm and imbue them in flesh. To give them life once more.\n"

"And so my husband created a golem of the boy's corpse—an Atronach, made of flesh, but with eyes as cold and empty as a Gemstone. He hid his plans until the rituals had completed, and then presented that slurring abomination to me, as though I could ever forgive him. He seemed truly shocked when I rent the pale echo of <<2>>'s spirit from its husk.\n"

"\n"
"하지만 '군주'이시여, 우리 가족의 비극은 감당하기 너무 거대한 것이었다. 남편은 그 굳은 '골통'으로 자신이 어떻게든 죽음을 극복해낼 수 있다고 믿었다. 지식을 추구하거나 용감하게 우리 집을 지켜낼 힘을 위해서가 아니었다. 한때 살아있던 것들을 떼어내서 이 영역에 다시 불러들이고는 살덩이에 채워넣으려 한 것이다. 다시 한번 생명을 주려는 것이었다.\n"

"\n"
"그리하여 내 남편은 시체로 이루어진 골렘을 만들어냈다. 살점으로 만들어진 '아트로나크'였지만, 그 눈은 차가웠고 '보석'처럼 비어 있었다. 그는 의식이 완료될 때까지 자기 계획을 감췄고, 그 더러운 흉물을 내 앞에 내보였다. 내가 자기를 용서해줄 거라고 생각한 것 마냥 말이다. 내가 그 껍데기에서 <<2>>의 영혼이 지닌 창백한 메아리를 찢어발기자 텔라카는 진심으로 충격받은 듯 보였다.\n"
"\n"
"나는 지금 내가 생명 그 자체보다도 더 사랑하는 남편을 가두었다. 내 손으로 그에게 진정한 처벌을 내릴 수가 없기 때문이다. 어쩌면 10년 정도의 세월이 혐오스러운 자신의 행동에 대해 생각하게 해줄지도 모른다.\n"

Most of the staff has fled as the fighting intensifies. Some have gone to join the wars, to return home to families. Others have gone to I know not where. A few of my colleagues remain, however. Dresan Keep is our home and its library of knowledge our life's work. I shall enlist their aid in preparing a safe space for the most important treasures in the library.

Someone, someday, will need the information we have collected, and they will know how to put it to good use.\n"

"We sacked the Chauvry Estate today, the culmination of months of planning, and it was an outstanding success. We found more loot than we could carry and achieved a vengeance long overdue. \n"

"At first, I wasn't sure about this venture. A campaign to find the descendants of the Bretons and Redguards involved in the sacking of Orsinium, to take their riches and lives as reparation? It sounded too good to be true, but today's success proves we can get revenge and turn a profit at the same time.\n"

"I'm beginning to have doubts about this outfit. I'm in this mainly for the gold, not to achieve fame, but our two leaders have other goals. They're fighting about which clan deserves credit for getting revenge on the Chauvrys.\n"
"\n"
"Thorzhul comes from Clan Agluk, a noble clan all but wiped out in the Siege of Orsinium. He constantly talks about the sacrifice his clan made. He says they deserve to be honored.\n"
"\n"
"Our other leader, Borzugh, is from the up-and-coming Clan Morkul. The clan started with Morkul himself, the general credited with several feats of heroism during the siege. Borzugh says Clan Agluk only lost so many because they were poor warriors. \n"
"\n"
"Borzugh and Thorzgul have both been trying to recruit the rest of us to their sides, but with so many clans represented here, it doesn't seem right for any single clan to take credit. Most of us don't want any part of this fight. Maybe we'd be better off to just let them kill each other …."

A shard containing a sliver of her essence should be embedded in the wall just inside the cave.
