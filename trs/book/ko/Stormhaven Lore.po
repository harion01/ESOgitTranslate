"Wayrest is one of the most glorious cities of western Tamriel—sparkling in her contemporary beauty, lustrous by her past. She is prized above all cities in High Rock. No other city has contributed so much to the culture of the Bretons. The spirits of her genius children continue to haunt the streets. You can see them in the gabled roofs, grand boulevards, and aromatic marketplaces. The people of Wayrest have an instinctive appreciation of their past, but are not obsessed by it, as the people of Daggerfall seem to be. One feels that one is in a modern city when one visits Wayrest, but there is a magic in the air that could only come from centuries of civilization.\n"
"\n"
"It is difficult for historians to declare a certain date for the foundation of Wayrest. Where the Bjoulsae River feeds the Iliac Bay, a settlement of some variety has existed since at least 1E 800. The traders and fishermen of Wayrest were surrounded by hostile parties. The Orc capital Orsinium had grown like a weed to the north, and pirates and raiders crowded the islands to the west. There is no mystery to Wayrest's name. After what most travelers had to endure at the eastern end of the Iliac Bay, the little fishing village on the Bjoulsae was a welcome rest.\n"
"\n"
"Nowhere in the much-vaunted censuses of the Skyrim Occupation is Wayrest mentioned. In the Annals of Daggerfall, King Joile's letter to Gaiden Shinji of 1E 948 contains the following reference: \"The Orcs have been plaguing the Wayresters and impeding traffic to the heart of the land.\"\n"
"\n"
"Wayrest only truly bloomed after the razing of Orsinium in 1E 980. Hard-working traders and merchants were instrumental in forming a trade alliance, thus reducing pirate activity on the bay. A successful mercantile family, the Gardners, built a walled palace in town and, over time, allowed banks and other businesses within its walls. A Gardner, Farangel, was proclaimed king when Wayrest was granted the right to call itself a kingdom in 1E 1100.\n"
"\n"
"Although Wayrest was ruled by one family, the merchants continued to wield incredible power. Many economists have alleged that Wayrest's eternal wealth, despite her hardships, comes from this rare relationship between merchants and crown. The Gardner Dynasty was followed by the Cumberland Dynasty, but never has a king of Wayrest been deposed by revolution or assassination. Every king of Wayrest can trace his line back to a merchant prince of Wayrest. The merchants and king respect one another, and this relationship strengthens both.\n"
"\n"
"Wayrest has survived blights, droughts, plagues, piracy, invasions, and war with good humor and practicality. In 1E 2702, the entire population of the city was forced to move into the walled estate of the Gardners as protection against pirates, raiders, and the Thrassian plague. A less resourceful community would have withered, but the Wayresters have survived to enrich Tamriel generation after generation."

"웨이레스트는 서부 탐리엘의 도시 중 가장 영광스러운 도시 중 하나다. 현재의 아름다움과 과거의 윤택함이 빛난다. 웨이레스트는 하이 락의 모든 도시 중 가장 소중한 도시다. 그 어떤 다른 도시도 웨이레스트만큼 브레튼의 문화에 영향을 끼치지 못했다. 웨이레스트의 총명한 아이들에게 잠재된 정신은 거리에 남아있다. 그 정신을 박공된 지붕, 거대한 도로와 향기나는 시장에서 눈으로 확인할 수 있다. 웨이레스트의 시민들은 그들의 과거에 대해 본능적인 찬사를 보내지만, 그에 안주하지 않는다. 대거폴의 시민이 으레 그래야하는 것 처럼. 어떤 이는 웨이레스트를 방문할때 현대의 도시만을 바라보지만,거기엔 수 세기를 거쳐온 문명에서만 나올 수 있는 마법이 공기에 가득하다.\n"
"\n"
"역사가들에게 있어 웨이레스트의 기원이 언제인가 물어보는 것은 어려운 질문이다. 욜세 강이 일리악 만을 살찌우고, 수 많은 이들이 정착한지는 최소 1E 800 부터이기 때문이다. 웨이레스트의 무역상들과 어부들은 위험한 이웃들에게 둘러싸여있다. 오크들의 수도인 오시니움은 북쪽을 바라보는 잡초처럼 자라났고, 해적과 약탈자들이 서쪽 섬에 가득하기 때문이다. 웨이레스트의 이름에는 아무런 숨겨진 비밀이 없다. 동쪽 일리악 만의 끝에서부터 견뎌오던 대부분의 여행자들에게 있어 작은 욜세의 어촌은 환영할만한 쉼터였기에.\n"
"\n"
"스카이림 점령지에서 인구가 많은 지역을 뽑을때 웨이레스트는 등장하지 않는다. 대거폴 연대기를 보면, 1E 948에 요일레 왕이 가이덴 신지에게 보낸 편지에 다음의 말이 적혀있다. \"오크들이 웨이레스트인들을 중독시키고 교통에 혼잡을 가져오고 있소.\"\n"
"\n"
"웨이레스트는 오시니움이 파괴되는 1E 980에 가서야 부흥하게 된다. 열일하는 상인들과 무역상들이 무역 연합을 형성하는데 중요한 기반이 되었고, 일리악 만의 해적 활동을 감소시키게 된다.  성공한 상업 가문인 가드너 가문은 마을에 성벽으로 둘러싼 궁정을 짓고, 시간이 흘러 은행과 다른 사업들이 궁정 내에서 활개를 띄게 된다. 1E 1100, 가드너 가문의 파란젤은 웨이레스트가 왕국이 될 수있는 위치에 서게 되자 스스로 왕을 칭하게 된다.\n"
"\n"
"웨이레스트는 한 가문이 통치했지만, 상인들은 여전히 엄청난 권력을 휘둘렀다. 상인과 제후간의 기묘한 관계에서 나오는 어려움에도 많은 경제학자들이 웨이레스트의 영원한 부를 예상했다. 가드너 왕조는 대가 끊기고 컴버랜드 왕조가 이어지게 되지만, 혁명이나 암살로 왕조가 바뀐 것은 아니었다.  웨이레스트의 왕위는 그 왕관을 가장 부유한 상인에게 내린 것이다. 상인과 왕은 서로를 존중했고, 이 관계는 더욱 깊어진다.\n"
"\n"
"웨이레스트는 질병, 가뭄, 전염병, 해적, 침략과 전쟁에서도 현실적이고 훌륭한 재치로 이를 이겨낸다. 1E 2702에 해적, 약탈자와  드라시안 역병으로부터 시민들을 보호하기 위해 위해 도시의 모든 시민이 강제로 성벽 안으로 이주하게 된다. 아둔한 다른 도시들은 이때문에 멸망하게 되지만, 웨이레스트 시민들은 살아남아 세대를 거쳐 탐리엘을 융성하게 하고있다."

"There is nothing like the Direnni Tower anywhere in Skyrim, save for High Hrothgar itself. Unlike the great mountain, which is a thing of nature, the tower is a structure—but one not constructed by Men or Mer, if the legends speak true, but by the Aedra themselves.\n"
"\n"
"It rises, stark and sheer, from the high center of Balfiera Island in the Iliac Bay, where it has stood since the dawn of time itself. Adamantine Tower, it is called, for the unknown, ageless material from which it is built, and Tower Zero, as the edifice that predates all other buildings on Mundus.\n"
"\n"
"The Direnni High Elves have ruled Balfiera since the beginning of the First Era. In common parlance the tower bears their name, though they can claim only the construction of the more recent keep that clusters around the tower's base. (Who is responsible for delving the catacombs beneath the keep is a matter of debate with no definitive consensus.)\n"
"\n"
"I have not consulted with the High Elves of Alinor (who has?), but the noble Croiden, Elden Antiquariat of the Direnni, deigned to answer a few questions. According to him, the tower was erected in the Dawn Era when the gods met to decide the fate of Mundus. At its apex, Auri-El, the great god of the Aldmeri, slew the trickster Lorkhan, impaled his heart on an arrow and launched it across the world. The heart merely laughed and lived on.\n"
"\n"
"The Aedra then withdrew from the affairs of Mundus, leaving behind the tower for the Direnni to discover and take for their own. What secrets did they find there? What have they concealed to this day? Whatever the secrets may be, the Direnni didn't reveal them to this humble Nord architect. \n"
"\n"
"However, secrets there must be, for I took sight-and-angle measurements of the Direnni Tower from the eight points of the compass. According to my calculations, and given the known characteristics of all available materials, building an edifice of its proportions should not be possible."

"하이 흐로스가를 제외한다면, 디레니 탑과 같은 것은 스카이림의 어디에서도 찾아 볼 수 없다.  자연적으로 만들어진 거대한 산들과는 다르게 이 탑은 건축물인데, 만약 전설이 사실이라면, 인간이나 엘프에 의해서가 아닌 에이드라에 의해 지어진 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"탑은 일리악 만의 발피에라 섬 중심지에서 태초부터 한결같이 그 자리에 솟아 있다. 탑의 재료인 알 수 없고 오래된 물질의 이름을 따서 '아다만틴 타워'라고 부르거나, 문두스에 지어진 다른 어떤 건물들보다 앞서 지어진 건축물이라는 의미로 '타워 제로'라고도 부르기도 한다.\n"
"\n"
"디레니의 하이엘프들은 발피에라를 제 1 시대부터 지배해왔다. 때문에 이 탑은 디레니 탑으로 가장 널리 불리지만, 사실 디레니들은 더 나중에 지어진 탑 주변의 요새들에 대한 소유권만이 있을 뿐이다. (요새 아래의 지하 묘지 유적에 대한 발굴 책임이 누구에게 있는지는 아직도 결론이 안 난 논란거리다.)\n"
"\n"
"나는 앨리노어의 하이엘프들에게는 조언을 구하진 않았지만 (누가 책임을 가지는지에 대해), 디레니 가문의 귀족 크로이덴은 몇 가지 질문에 선뜻 답변을 주었다. 그에 따르면, 탑은 신들이 문두스의 운명을 결정하기 위해 만났던 여명의 시대에 세워졌다. 탑의 꼭대기에서는 알드메리의 위대한 신 아우리엘이 사기꾼 로칸을 물리치고, 화살에 그의 심장을 꽃아 세계를 가로질러 발사했다. 심장은 이를 비웃듯 여전히 살아움직였다.\n"
"\n"
"그 후 에이드라는 문두스의 일에서 손을 뗏고, 탑을 영원히 떠나서 디레니들이 발견하고 차지하게 두었다. 과연 이들은 탑에서 무엇을 발견했을까? 이들이 지금까지 숨겨온 것은 무엇일까? 이들이 탑에서 발견한게 무엇이든지 간에, 디레니들은 이 미천한 노드 건축가에게 아무 것도 공개한 것이 없다.\n"
"\n"
"하지만 이 건축물에는 반드시 어떠한 비밀이 있다. 나는 디레니 탑을 나침반의 여덟 방향에서 보이는 모습과 각도를 측정했던 적이 있는데, 내 계산과 현재까지 알려진 재료의 특성에 따르면, 이 거대한 건물을 이런 비율로 건축하는 것은 불가능하기 때문이다."

"'Twas in Menevia, dear, green Menevia, there dwelt a young Breton of family and name. He had inherited a patrimony, and thus needed to do nothing, as others were paid to do for him. And so he sat at his mullioned window and gazed out the diamond panes at the colors of the countryside as they changed with the light. And he dreamed away the day, until the colors darkened and he betook himself to bed, where he slumbered and dreamed in truth.\n"
"\n"
"Of what did he dream? He dreamed of his own land, but in colors more intense, more true, and more pure than in day. His Menevia of Dreams was more real than his Menevia of Waking, and he felt more alive when asleep than awake. Each day at his mullions, he looked and longed for a way to dream beyond dreams—a way to live in his Reverie-Menevia forever and forever.\n"
"\n"
"\"Reverie-Menevia,\" he said, and it was a prayer. \"Reverie-Menevia. Reverie-Menevia.\" A thousand, thousand times he uttered this prayer, and it changed like a dream to \" 'Ver'-Menevia, 'ver'-Menevia,\" and more and more it became less and less, until at last, \"Vaermina,\" he said, and, \"Vaermina,\" and.  \"Vaermina\" again.\n"
"\n"
"And to him she came in Dream-Form, Vaermina Herself, and called him Supernal Dreamer, and First Nightcaller, and named him Omen of a Hundred Prophecies. And when he awoke, he yet did dream, and spoke as in a dream, and called other dreamers to him, and to Reverie-Menevia.\n"

"For several seasons I have been observing the Stonechewer Goblin tribe, recording their daily activities and becoming familiar with their customs and routines. Over time I have deliberately crept closer and closer to the limits of their tribal camp, occasionally showing myself briefly so the subjects would become used to my proximity. At one point a warrior out to relieve himself behind a tree stumbled upon my observation post, and when he grunted and drew his crude-but-serviceable short sword I thought my work had come to an untimely end. Luckily the tribal shaman was nearby, and he intervened on my behalf, speaking harshly to the warrior and knocking aside his sword. The shaman pointed at me and slowly rotated his hand near his head, which I assume is a Goblin gesture denoting acknowledgement of superior intellect. Who would have suspected these so-called primitives had such regard for scholarship?\n"
"\n"
"After that there were no more incidents of hostility, and the Goblins tolerated my presence, so long as I kept a respectful distance from their females and offspring. Occasionally a warrior would bark at me, but I simply replied by making the hand-rotating \"intelligence\" gesture next to my head, and the warrior would shrug and go back to his business.\n"
"\n"
"As so little is known about the religious practices of the Goblin race, I decided to make the shaman of the tribe my particular study. The symbol of his office was a bone rod, probably a femur, with a small skull affixed to the end—possibly an infant's. This skull was ornamented with an assortment of feathers, spines, and animal claws, and filled with something like nut-hulls, for it rattled loudly when shaken. The shaman would shake this holy symbol forcefully when summoning his congregation to sacred rituals, or when the females were not bringing him food or drink rapidly enough.\n"
"\n"
"At particularly important rituals the shaman would touch the symbol to his heart, then his head, then point it to the sky and call out, \"Muluk!\" At first I found this confusing, given the similarity of \"muluk\" to the Goblin words \"muulk,\" which they use when chastising their durzogs or children, or \"mluku,\" the term for fecal matter. But gradually I learned to differentiate, and one day I realized that by crying \"Muluk!\" the shaman must be invoking the god of the Goblins. \n"
"\n"
"And then it struck me: \"Muluk\" is not really much different from \"Mauloch.\" Could the god of the Goblins and the god of the Orcs be one and the same? \n"
"\n"
"This is the kind of discovery that could win me tenure at the College of Wayrest! I must get independent confirmation of this revelation. But how?"

"\n"
"That Men and Mer can interbreed has been known since the first humans began arriving on the shores of Tamriel in the middle of the Merethic Era. However, broad intermingling of Elves and humans only occurred in the far northwest of the continent, giving rise to the race of Men known as the Bretons. Given the history of conflict between humans and the children of Aldmeris elsewhere in Tamriel, how and why did this intermingling occur in High Rock? \n"
"\n"
"The answer lies in the peculiar (for Elves) culture of Clan Direnni, the once-dominant Mer of northwest Tamriel. In contrast to the Ayleids of Cyrodiil, who brutally enslaved any humans they came into contact with, the Direnni simply conquered their local Nedes and then ruled them as a caste of nobility. The aristocratic Elves established a system of feudal vassalage over their human subjects, with rights and privileges that included the \"Perquisite of Coition\" with any human they desired. Sex with attractive Nedes was considered casual recreation, and Direnni nobles competed to have stables of the most desirable human subjects. \n"
"\n"
"The inevitable Half-Elven offspring from these liaisons were not adopted into the families of their Direnni parents, being considered sub-Mer, but were nonetheless often given privileged positions among the subject Nedes. Over time, this led to the establishment of a recognized caste of mixed-blood humans, who were given the name \"Bretons\" (from the Ehlnofex \"beratu,\" or \"half\"). The Breton caste was only allowed to marry humans, so over time their Elven blood became more diluted, and the Nedic appearance predominated. \n"
"\n"
"Though they wielded great power for a time in the First Era, even then the Elves of Clan Direnni were never numerous, and as their geographical hegemony expanded administration and rulership was increasingly handed off to the Breton caste. After defeating the invading Alessian Horde in 1E 482 Clan Direnni was scattered and effectively exhausted. As the Elves retreated to central High Rock, then finally Balfiera Isle, the Bretons stepped easily into their shoes, assuming the feudal hierarchy established by the Direnni and simply replacing them with their own noble families. \n"
"\n"
"The Breton nobles, who had been forced to differentiate themselves from the Direnni part of their heritage, justified their new ascension by distancing themselves from Elves and everything Elven—ironically so, as the Elven blood ran strongest in the older noble families. The Direnni were increasingly vilified by their former vassals, and the island clan became ever more insular and isolationist. However, they were still known as powerful magicians, and they were strong enough to repel an attempted Redguard invasion in 1E 907.\n"
"\n"
"The Bretons continued redefining themselves, inventing a myth of a history of noble resistance to Direnni rule, and developing a thriving merchant class that began trading around the coasts of Tamriel. By the time the Empress Hestra and her legions arrived at Bangkorai Pass in 1E 1029, they were ready to join the Empire of Men and embrace the Eight Divines. Under the Remans, High Rock was possibly the most stable and prosperous province in the Second Empire. \n"
"\n"
"Which brings us back to the (deliberately provocative) question of our title: are the Bretons then mongrels, or paragons? The answer, of course, is both (though if you call a Breton a mongrel, he is liable to feed you an inch or two of steel). The passionate race of Bretons embodies the strengths of both Men and Mer—as well as their flaws."

"The Breton passion for feudal hierarchy pervades every aspect of High Rock society, from the lowliest peasant farmer to the High King in Wayrest. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the curious phenomenon of the Breton knightly orders. \n"
"\n"
"Here in Hammerfell, we Redguards sensibly award equal citizenship to every man or woman who knows which end of the sword to grasp. Oh, we have our governing class, of course, as civilization must be ordered and maintained, but below this aristocracy there are few distinctions. \n"
"\n"
"Not so in High Rock, where everyone is aware of their degree of nobility, which is invariably traced back to those Breton families who led the region's liberation from the overlordship of the Direnni Elves. High Rock cultural history is founded on tales of the noble and chivalrous \"Breton Knights\" who flung off the yoke of their Elven masters. After these knights drove the Direnni back to Balfiera Island, they founded the knightly orders to carry on the tradition of nobles-in-arms, and to ensure that High Rock would have able and ready defenders in times of trouble. \n"
"\n"
"So the stories go, at least. Today, every petty kingdom and duchy in High Rock has its own knightly order, with traditions that supposedly date back to the glory days of the Breton Liberation. The Knights of the Dragon in Daggerfall, the Knights of the Flame in Alcaire, the Order of Saint Pelin in Evermore—the list goes on and on. \n"
"\n"
"And what, nowadays, do these knightly orders do to justify their gleaming greatswords and shining mail? If we look beyond the banners and pageantry, we find that the chivalric orders fulfill two main purposes in High Rock society. \n"
"\n"
"First, they provide an acceptably \"noble\" calling for the excess sons and daughters of the aristocracy. Over time, as trade has made High Rock prosperous, the profession of merchant has become an accepted alternative to feudal lordship for the children of the nobility, but frankly, not every baron's son has a head for numbers and negotiation. For these spare heirs, there's always a membership available in the local knightly order. \n"
"\n"
"Second, the bestowal of a knighthood on a lower-class man or woman is a convenient way to reward outstanding contributions to society (or to the elevating lord), and confers a measure of that nobility so prized in Breton society. Where the commoner is rewarded for achievements other than in conflict—and this is the case in the majority of knighthoods—the membership in the local knightly order is only nominal, and the new sir or dame is not expected to take up sword and shield. However, if their achievements were in the all-important realm of trade, the new \"merchant knight\" is expected to contribute heavily and regularly to the order's financial maintenance. \n"
"\n"
"So if you're visiting Wayrest or Evermore on a mission of diplomacy or trade, don't be surprised if the head of a shipping company is introduced as Sir Doric, or the owner of a string of hostels is called Dame Lizabette. You're simply meeting one of the fabled Breton Knights of High Rock."

"여기 해머펠에서 우리 레드가드는 검을 쥐는 방식을 아는 남녀 모두에게 평등한 시민권을 주고 있다. 그렇게 우리들에게도 지배 계급이 있는 것이다. 모름지기 문명이란 지시와 관리가 딸려오는 것이다. 하지만, 이 귀족 정치와 비교하면 차이는 거의 없다.\n"
"\n"
"하이락에서는 사정이 달라, 모두가 자신의 계급이 얼마나 높은지 자각하고 있다. 그것은 디레니 엘프의 대군주들로부터 영토를 해방한 브레튼 일족까지 거슬러 올라간다. 하이락 문화 역사의 기반에는 엘프의 지배를 물리친 용감한 '브레튼 기사'의 이야기가 존재한다. 이 기사들은 디레니를 발페라의 섬까지 후퇴시킨 뒤, 귀족의 전통을 지키기 위해 그리고 유사 시 하이락이 스스로를 지키기 위해 기사 사회를 구축한 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"적어도 이야기에서는 그렇다. 오늘날 하이락에 있는 모든 왕국과 공작령은 독자적인 기사 사회를 구축하고 있으며, 브레튼 해방의 전성기까지 거슬러 올라갈 정도로 그 전통이 깊다. 대거폴의 용기사단, 알리키어의 화염의 기사단, 에버모어의 성 페린 기사단 등, 그 수를 셀 수 없을 정도이다.\n"
"\n"
"이들 기사단은 광휘를 내뿜는 대검과 미늘 속옷을 정당화하기 위해 요즘 어떤 임무를 수행하고 있는 것인가? 그들의 깃발과 호화로운 의식으로부터 예상해보면, 기사단은 하이락 사회에서 주로 두 개의 목적을 달성하고 있는 것을 알 수 있다.\n"
"\n"
"첫 번째로, 그들은 수 많은 귀족의 아들딸이 만족할 수 있을만큼 '고귀한' 직업을 부여하고 있다. 무역으로 하이락이 번영한 것처럼, 오랜 시간에 걸쳐 상인이라는 직업은 귀족의 자제들에게 있어 군주를 대신 할 직업으로 받아들여졌다. 하지만, 실제로는 남작의 자제 모두에게 수학과 교섭의 재능이 있는 것은 아니었다. 이들 수 많은 후계자의 후보에게 있어, 본토의 기사 사회에는 항상 자신이 획득할 수 있는 지위가 존재한다.\n"
"\n"
"두 번째로, 하층계급 사람들에게 기사작위를 부여하는 것은 사회에 대한 커다란 공헌에 대해 보상을 주는 손쉬운 수단이다. 그들은 브레튼 사회에서 중요한 계급을 얻게 된다. 기사 대부분은 이러한 경우이지만, 평민이 전투 이외의 공적으로 기사작위를 받는 경우 그 기사단에서 남는 것은 오직 이름뿐이다. 이러한 '경'은 유사시 검과 방패를 들어올리는 것은 공적이 무역에서 극히 중요한 것이라면, 새로운 '상인 기사'이라는 직업은 기사단의 재정 유지에 대해 중요하고도 지속적인 공헌을 기대할 수 있을 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"외교나 무역으로 웨이레스트나 에버모아에 와서, 수송 사회의 우두머리로서 도릭 경이 소개되거나, 여러 숙박소를 경영하는 리자베트 경이 불려지더라도 부디 놀라지 않기를 바란다. 눈 앞에 있는 것은 하이락의 전설적인 브레튼의 기사 중 오직 한 명에 지나지 않을테니 말이다."

"by Janise Muric, Third Warden of the Faithful Circle\n"
"\n"
"Chapter One: Durak's Early Years\n"
"\n"
"Though Abbot Durak is our spiritual leader, he has never been comfortable with the title. Old Master Ugbak once said that relates to his upbringing in the ruins of Orsinium. Anyone can see that Durak is small for an Orc, and one could speculate that his brothers' bullying led him to pursue a mystical path, one unusual for Orcs.\n"
"\n"
"As Ugbak tells it, Durak's story begins in Orsinium, where his lot was hard and lonely. Durak's life changed when he first heard whispers in the night—whispers from the Daedric Prince Azura. Azura said Durak would accomplish a great task: he would come to Stormhaven and found an order of worshipers in her name. These \"Spirit Wardens\" would prepare for a time of chaos, when Stormhaven's people would suffer from a madness of nightmares.\n"
"\n"
"Durak knew better than to share these whispers with his brothers. He already faced ridicule for his study of magic and lack of physical prowess. Soon after, he left his home in Orsinium and struck out on the long journey to Stormhaven, carrying nothing more than his staff and the clothes on his back.\n"
"\n"
"Durak found his way to Stormhaven, but he had no idea how he was to found this order of \"spirit wardens\" or where they would live. Soon he despaired. One night, as he took shelter beneath the Weeping Giant, the whispers came again. The silken voice of Azura spoke of a path hidden in the hills west of Moonlit Maw. At its top, Durak found an ancient abbey, abandoned and overgrown. This, he knew, would be the home of the spirit wardens—and so it became our temple to Azura.\n"
"\n"
"Under Durak's leadership, we are prepared for Vaermina's plague of dreams. We were founded to protect Stormhaven from its nightmares, and we will do so to our dying breaths."

"제 1장: 듀락의 어린시절\n"
"\n"
"아봇 듀락은 우리들의 정신적인 지주임에도 불구하고 항상 자신의 직위에 불안해 했다. 한번은 장로 우그박이 그 이유를 말한 적이 있었는데, 과거 오시니움 폐허의 기억과 관련이 있다고 했다. 그 당시 듀락은 지금도 그렇듯 오크 치고는 작은 체구를 가지고 있었고, 형제들의 괴롭힘은 그를 다른 오크들과는 다른 미지의 길로 그를 몰아넣었다.\n"
"\n"
"우그박의 말대로, 듀락의 이야기는 그가 수많은 외로움과 고통을 함께한 오시니움에서 시작 된다. 어느날 밤, 듀락은 알 수 없는 속삭임을 들었고, 그것이 그의 삶을 송두리채 바꿔놓았다. 그것은 바로 데이드릭 프린스, 아주라의 속삭임이었다. 아주라는 듀럭에게 그가 위대한 업적을 완수할 운명이라고 속삭였다: 스톰헤이븐에서, 예정된 아주라의 추종자들을 만날 것이고, 그 \"영혼의 추종자들\"은 다가올 혼돈의 시대를 준비할 것이다. 그리고 혼돈의 시대속에서 스톰헤이븐의 사람들은 악몽의 광기에 고통받을 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"듀락은 이미 몇차례나 그의 형제들에게서 마법에 대한 재능이나, 신체적인 기량으로 조롱당한 적이 있었기에, 이 놀라운 속삭임을 그들에게 이야기해도 아무런 소용이 없다는 것을 알고 있었다. 그리고 얼마 지나지 않아, 듀락은 지팡이와 옷가지들만 짊어지고 스톰헤이븐을 향해 긴 여정을 떠났다.\n"
"\n"
"스톰헤이븐에 도착하고 나서야, 듀락은 아주라가 속삭였던 \"영혼의 추종자\"들을 어디서 찾아야할지, 또 그들이 어디 사는지도 모른다는 사실에 절망했다. '울고 있는 거인'에서 그가 머물고 있던 어느날 밤, 또다시 속삭임이 들려왔다. 비단결과도 같은 목소리로 아주라는 그에게 '달이 비추는 나락' 서쪽 언덕에 위치한 비밀통로를 알려주었다. 언덕의 정상에서, 듀락은 오래 전 버려져 덩쿨과 잡초에 파묻힌 고대의 수도원을 발견했다. 그것을 보고 듀락은 직감했다. 이곳이 바로 아주라가 속삭했던 \"영혼의 추종자들\"의 집이 될 것이라고. 그리고 지금, 우리가 함께하고 있는 아주라 신전이 바로 그 장소이다.\n"
"\n"
"듀락은 통솔하에, 우리들은 베르미나의 꿈의 전염병에 대비했다. 우리는 악몽에서 스톰헤이븐을 지켜내기 위해 모였으며, 우리의 숨이 붙어있는 한 끝까지 그 뜻을 지켜나갈 것이다."

"\n"
"Once, we were great. \n"
"\n"
"Once, our battlereeves were masters of warfare, and our sapiarchs were wise and learned. Once, we ruled all High Rock from the Eltheric Ocean to the mountains of Wrothgar, and the Nedes were our thralls and concubines. \n"
"\n"
"Once, Direnni Cygnus, the Swan of Tyrigel, discovered Balfiera and its Tower and claimed it for her own, decreeing that all of her clan who came after would bear her name. \n"
"\n"
"Once, the art of Alchemy was all but undefined, until Asliel Direnni compiled his \"Compendious Almanac of Reagents,\" and was invited to join the first Psijics on Artaeum.\n"
"\n"
"Once, before Raven Direnni and her \"Rules of Eldritch Binding,\" all Enchanting was unique, and enchantments failed nineteen times out of twenty. \n"
"\n"
"Once, during the Alessian Reforms, Ryan Direnni stood up to the entire Empire. His Breton Legions, armed and commanded by Direnni Elves, controlled all the land as far east as Markarth and Elinhir. The Orc-hold of Orsinium has been sacked many times, but we Direnni sacked it first. \n"
"\n"
"Once, at the Battle of Glenumbria Moors, Aiden Direnni's vastly outnumbered troops routed the entire Alessian Horde, then chased them back to Cyrodiil. \n"
"\n"
"Once, before Corvus Direnni codified the rules of Conjuration, every summoning of even a minor Daedra was an act to be feared and avoided. \n"
"\n"
"Once, Peregrine Direnni drove an entire Ra Gada flotilla back to Sentinel by merging her very will with the waves of the Iliac Bay. \n"
"\n"
"Once, in a single day, Pelladil Direnni built Blackrose Prison from the scattered rubble of Lilmothiit ruins by summoning an army of Stone Atronachs. \n"
"\n"
"Yes, we were great once. But no matter what our individual achievements, every Direnni since Cygnus has been eaten from within by failure. \n"
"\n"
"Because we cannot solve the mystery of the Zero Stone, and use it to open the Argent Aperture which it wards. \n"
"\n"
"At maturity, every Direnni of high blood is brought into the Tower, conducted to the Foundation Vault, and shown the Zero Stone. We are allowed to touch it—once—so as to feel the transcendent mystical power that courses through it, a power we have never been able to tap. And we are shown the Argent Aperture in the adjacent metallic wall, that door with its lock of thirteen slowly counter-rotating rings, a portal we have never been able to open. \n"
"\n"
"And we console ourselves that if we Direnni have never been able to siphon the Stone or unlock the Aperture, well then certainly, neither could anyone else. We return to the world above, and we do something spectacular—so we will not have to face our failure. \n"
"\n"
"But once, as our lives near their ends, each of us gathers together all our knowledge, the fruits of all our achievements, and once more makes that descent to the Foundation Vault. To try it. Just once. \n"
"\n"
"Most are found within a day or two, dead and horribly distorted. Some, like my darling Heron, live on though terribly disfigured, too brain-blasted to understand what has happened to them. \n"
"\n"
"Me? I keep to our chambers in the Tourmaline Steeple, caring for Heron by day, and translating Ayleid tomes in the library by night. And it's a good enough life, too. \n"
"\n"
"Though sometimes, when working on an ancient grimoire or librus magus I question whether the arcane writings of our long-lost cousins are not better left a mystery. \n"
"\n"
"But then I think, is not all knowledge useful for something? And I think, what might this knowledge be useful for? \n"
"\n"
"And I think I might take that long walk downstairs. \n"
"\n"
"Just once."
