"This thesis is the result of three hundred and seventy disassemblies and reconstructions of skeevaton fabricants throughout the\n"
"\n"
"<I omitted the next seven plates of droning introduction. You'd think metal engraving would encourage brevity.>\n"
"\n"
"Standard Functionality\n"
"\n"
"Identifier: Unless removed, all skeevatons possess a sensory tool more sophisticated than their basic auditory and visual equipment. Mounted on a telescoping rod, the Identifier sends out pulses of detection magic to survey objects of interest and search within specific parameters.\n"
"\n"
"<This was the only noteworthy device in the standard design. Unless you're fascinated by scent interpreters.>\n"
"\n"
"Skeevaton Modification\n"
"\n"
"Skeevatons are found throughout Clockwork City, even in extremely hazardous environments. Tinkerers have managed to get around the weaknesses of the fabricant's diminutive size by incorporating some offensive and defensive devices.\n"
"\n"
"Gear Shifting: One of the most common modifications I've encountered involves a secondary set of motility gears meant to increase the skeevaton's speed in short bursts. Certainly useful when they need to traverse the inner workings of active machinery.\n"
"\n"
"<Simple enough, but weight will be a limiting factor.>\n"
"\n"
"Energy Absorption: Skeevatons are sometimes fitted with a micro-magicka condenser allowing them to temporarily store and transport energy without a charged soul gem. The practical uses for this are theoretically limitless, but retaining a powerful magical charge provides some defensive uses as well.\n"
"\n"
"Discharge Energy: A fully charged micro-magicka condenser can release its volatile payload in an emergency, sending raw Destruction magic erupting in all directions. This should be done only under desperate circumstances or safe conditions as the blast can easily overload active constructs.\n"
"\n"
"Deploy-able Barrier: While skeevatons with reinforced chassis are more common, one of the more effective defenses I've discovered is a form of emitted barrier that the skeevaton can project over a sizable radius, allowing it to protect not only itself, but other vulnerable objects as well.\n"
"\n"
"Shock Chassis: A few mischief makers and would-be saboteurs have outfitted skeevatons with dangerous modifications that generate a powerful destructive shock through the fabricant's exterior. This jolt is painful to living things and fry animunculi.\n"
"\n"
"Restoration Emitter: While most skeevatons are equipped with physical tools to conduct repairs, one ingenious model incorporated a modification that generated a restorative magical field around the skeevaton that mended distressed metal, dissipated residual heat, stabilized energy emissions, and other processes used to maintain smooth operation.\n"
"\n"
"<These modifications are marvelous, but there simply isn't enough room in a skeevaton to incorporate everything. I'll need to decide what's best tailored to certain roles.>\n"
"\n"
"Trans-corporeal Operation: While most skeevatons I have reverse engineered have operated autonomously to carry out simple or routine tasks, I encountered several that had been tinkered with to allow an individual direct control over the fabricant. These modifications ranged from cumbersome wires, resembling a puppeteer's strings, and hand-held tonal emitters to a trans-corporeal pneumeria chamber that allows a being to inhabit the fabricant itself! This modified Dwemer device ingeniously converts a being into pure Liminal energy and stores it within a hermetic chamber. When connected to a fabricant the intelligence of the occupant may operate the fabricant as an extension of their animus. Obviously, this allows for unprecedented precision of control, but it also carries immense risk. If the skeevaton were to suffer a catastrophic failure while the pneumeria chamber was occupied, the animus would be violently ejected and almost certainly kill the occupant, if they even rematerialized at all.\n"
"\n"
"<I wouldn't have thought to use a pneumeria chamber to contain metaphysical material, but I shouldn't be surprised. Tonal devices often blur the lines between material and immaterial. I can think of a few uses for this.>"

"I found a partial account of a long-range Ayleid raid upon Mzulft that mentioned the Wrathstone at least nine times. The conflict revolved around the artifact, which is odd since by the Dwemers' own account it was not within the city and the timing is all off. Why would the Ayleids attack the Dwemer while their empire was in the midst of a slave rebellion?\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"Mzulft was plagued by conflict in the years surrounding that account. The city repelled attacks from the Nords, Ayleids, and even neighboring Dwemer clans. Were they all after the Wrathstone?\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"The great Dwemer architect, Mhuvnak, disappeared from Mzulft around this time. The prevailing theory is that he was a casualty of war, but from what I've found, there's no reason to believe Mzulft suffered any significant losses before the Nords sacked it during the reign of High King Gellir.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"I have it! Kagrenzel. Mhuvnak departed for Kagrenzel after the Ayleid raid. He'd have no reason to leave the safety of the city for a small holdout in the mountains unless there was something important there. Tomorrow I make for Eastmarch.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"Another setback. The pair of Nords I hired as an escort fell, quite literally, into a death trap almost immediately. This place reminds me more of Yokudan tombs than Dwemer remnants. It seems like its entire purpose is to kill those who would search it.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"After a very cautious search of Kagrenzel, I'm confident that the Wrathstone is not here. My current theory is that Mhuvnak came here to retrieve it. For all its devious designs, this place is best suited for catching thieves, not rebuffing an army. Mhuvnak must not have trusted the defenses to protect the artifact from his rivals.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"Mhuvnak was the most brilliant architect of his time. I don't believe someone as meticulous as he was to just take the Wrathstone and run off without a plan. Mzulft may have more answers.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"I decided to forgo an escort this time. I don't have much luck with them and I'll need to take my time searching Mzulft for answers. Unsurprisingly, animunculi still roam the halls continuing their duties in an unbroken circuit for all time. I hear things though, echoing from deep in the ruins. Muffled clatter and animal shrieks. Something is keeping the constructs occupied, and that's a benefit to me, for now.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"I'm running out of paper to contain my notes on Mzulft thus far, and I've only scratched the surface of this city. Most scholars would be content to spend their lives unraveling the secrets of this place, but I have my sights set higher than most. No more distractions. Find what I can about Mhuvnak and where he may have escaped to.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"There is an observatory of sorts in Mzulft, dominated by a device that fills the room. I've never seen anything like it. I didn't think Dwemer were known for their appreciation of the world above them, let alone the sky.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"There are surviving writings here. Not from the time of Mhuvnak, but long after. The Dwemer reclaimed Mzulft from the Nords and were thriving before their ultimate disappearance. This device, the Oculory, could observe the world with frightening acuity, when it worked. The Dwemer were using it to locate the lost Vault of Mhuvnak, but the \"Frostvault\" is buried in a mountain of ice. I've found no record of an attempt to reclaim it for their kingdom.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"If I've interpreted things correctly, I believe I know where the Frostvault may be found; however, I'm running low on funds. Quintus's estate was more debt than assets and if I'm to see this through I can't afford to be wrong.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"I'm on the right path, I'm sure of it. I found evidence of Dwemer construction in the mountains to the west. It looks like the ice has retreated in the ages between when my records were written and today. I'd love to see what else the melting glacier has revealed, but the resulting crevasse has become an attractive shelter for Goblins. After everything I've been through, I will not be stopped by a band of grubby rat-eaters. I'll take the gamble and put everything on this being the site of the Frostvault."

"I'm surprised Quintus was ever allowed to walk the halls of the Imperial Library. If the number of records left in his estate are any indication, he was as delinquent a borrower there as any bank in Cyrodiil. No one came to collect after I sorted out the matter of inheritance, so they're mine now.\n"

"There might be more about the Dwemer found in these dusty boxes than anywhere in the world. I could spend years digging through the volumes, but I'm curious about what else Quintus was up to in the months before the expedition to Volenfell.\n"

"My late husband's organizational habits were atrocious, but right now I appreciate his tendency to hoard things. He had several dog-eared volumes and a dozen scrolls relating to the Ayleids mixed in with his research on the Dwemer, even a few originals. I almost dismissed them due to Quintus's slovenly nature, but even he wouldn't have overlooked that much material being out of place. There's still a lot to go through, but it seems like the witless bastard actually found something.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"I never thought I would be grateful for Quintus's abysmal organizational skills, but here we are. Who knows how long these volumes would have sat gathering dust while I focused my efforts on the Dwemer? He was translating correspondence between Ayleid kingdoms during the Alessian Slave Rebellion with the help of an Ayleid language treatise by the late Tjurhane Fyrre. I intend to decipher the source material myself, but from what I can gather the Ayleids were scrambling to respond to the fall of the White-Gold Tower.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"My translation of the Ayleid scrolls confirms that several of the Ayleid kingdoms at war with their rebelling slaves were concocting a plan to turn the tide back in their favor. There are numerous references to an artifact called the Wrathstone, which the Ayleids believed was their answer. They suspected that the Dwemer had it in their possession. They intended to take it from them, by force, and it seems they failed, but I need to confirm that.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"I take back everything nice I said about Quintus' mess. I'll die of old age before I find what I need in his collections. If there is a method to this madness, it's lost on me, but he never appeared to have difficulty finding what he was looking for in his squalor. Much as I'd like to never see his face again, I'm going to need that treacherous mind of his.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"I'll have to keep that necromancer in mind if I ever return to Volenfell. I don't usually trust the Undaunted with delicate matters, but she seemed to have a good head on her shoulders. She was more than happy to \"reunite\" me with my late husband, though it took some convincing to get her to let me keep him. The pneumeria chamber I modified is working better than I hoped. Quintus is locked up tight and I can communicate with him as needed. Unfortunately, I can't shut him up as needed.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"Quintus spent a week venting before he finally realized that his obstinacy was pointless. He's agreed to help me complete his research on the Wrathstone. Enduring his witless barbs is small price to pay.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"I made the right decision. Quintus was really on to something. He always did have a head for conspiracy. According to the historical record, the Ayleid attacks on the Dwemer were thwarted and they were ultimately crushed by the Alessians. End of story. But if that was the case, why were the Tharns surveying Ayleid ruins not long after the death of Tjurhane Fyrre, and how did House Tharn convince the Potentate to divert resources to building a remote coastal fort during the middle of the biggest civil war in the Empire's history? Aside from the one right now, of course.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"I don't know how Quintus got his hands on some of these records, but I'd suspect a few favors from the Thieves Guild were involved. The official story of Fort Mistwatch was that it collapsed and was washed away by unseasonable flooding, but that news comes suspiciously after an object was unearthed under the fort. Details are slim, but by the description it could be the Wrathstone. Did they cover up their discovery? I need to see for myself. They may have left something behind that will put me on the trail."

"Huntsman of the Princes. Father of Manbeasts. The Hungry Cat. Hircine has many names, but all relate to his one known sphere; the hunt. The Daedric Prince is obsessed with the chase, the capture, the kill; whether the prey be mer, man, or beast.\n"

"Hircine is a favored subject of worship in Tamriel, although it is not out of line to question this popularity. None would go so far as to call him a deity of benevolence.

All his followers must do is prove themselves to him. Do so, and they are promised an afterlife of endless hunts within his Hunting Grounds.\n"
"\n"
"The Hunting Grounds\n"
"\n"
"Followers of Hircine are promised one thing; an afterlife within the Prince's realm of Oblivion, known as the Hunting Grounds. An endless forest where endless hunts are held. A land of savagery and violence, where an eternal cycle of death and rebirth take place. \n"
"\n"
"Hunting lodges dot the landscape, home to the souls which haunt this realm. Powerful beasts lurk within the forests, allowing Hircine's followers to indulge in spectacular hunts. A true paradise for those who have dedicated their life to the Huntsman Prince.\n"
"\n"
"The Great Hunt\n"
"\n"
"Though a rare occurrence, Hircine does allow the living to enter his realm. This event is known as the Great Hunt, a deadly competition held for the Huntsman Prince's amusement. This contest of skill and cunning has only one goal in mind; capture the Hare and present it to Hircine. Only then will you earn his favor.\n"
"\n"
"Many die during this bid for Hircine's boon. It's not uncommon for competitors to turn against one another, or to be killed by one of the many natural dangers the realm presents. And the Hare itself, of course, never goes down without a fight.\n"
"\n"
"Lycanthropy\n"
"\n"
"Hircine's title Father of Manbeasts is a well earned one. He's believed to be the creator of lycanthropy, the ability for mer and man to transform into beastial creatures. The most well known of these lycanthropes are werewolves.\n"
"\n"
"Those infected with lycanthropy, whether by birth or infection, are cursed with an aggressive madness that compels them to bloodlust. Upon their death, they are sent to spend their afterlife within the Hunting Grounds. This is regardless of their allegiance to Hircine.\n"
"\n"
"There's no known documentation of a soul escaping the Hunting Grounds, but there is one possibility. If a competitor of the Great Hunt would ask for a soul's freedom as their boon, Hircine will be compelled to free that individual's soul. And that is exactly what I must do if I ever wish for my father to be free of that savage realm."

"\n"
"I realize Commander Edette's concerns are not unfounded, and I cannot deny the risks of such a venture. To even find a werewolf transformed by Hircine would be a tremendous task. And then to capture the creature? There's absolutely no guarantee that the Silver Dawn would be capable of such a feat.\n"

"Unfortunately, Commander Edette still stands in my way. Her word is law within this keep, and every mention of my research only seems to fill her with a stronger resolve to deny me. \n"

"I'm afraid my most recent experiments have been nothing but remarkably disappointing. While my earlier testing yielded unacceptably little, my current methods have led to some rather unfortunate setbacks. \n"
"\n"
"Namely, the death of eight members of the pack.\n"
"\n"
"Five of the subjects appeared to have a mental break under the pressure of testing, resulting in an aggressive form of insanity. I had no choice but to put them down, for the safety of myself and fellow researchers. Most unfortunate, given that their strength did seem to greatly increase.\n"
"\n"
"It was under these circumstances that I lost Subject 42. A shame, as he was one of the few Nords within the pack. I had hoped to perhaps secure his wife for the next round of testing, but Mylenne refused my request. I do hope our dear second-in-command is not letting herself get sentimental.\n"
"\n"
"Three of the subjects simply died, most likely from the sheer physical strain. I had hoped that our vetting process would have eliminated any subjects too weak to undergo testing, but I suppose not everything can be accounted for. I'll have to compile any similarities that were known between these subjects.\n"
"\n"
"And then there was the case of Subject 46; a young Khajiit woman who was slotted for testing because of her hesitancy to perform certain tasks. A most interesting case, that one. I still have no leads as to why my testing caused the subject to become immune to Vykosa's power of compulsion.\n"
"\n"
"However, there's no mistaking these results, no matter how loath our glorious alpha was to admit it. Luckily, I was able to keep Subject 46 from being executed. After all, the possibility that she may be the key to breaking out of Vykosa's control is a promising prospect.\n"

"Caught in the Dragon's Teeth\n"
"\n"
"By Neramo\n"
"\n"
"Perhaps one of the most storied, yet least understood legacies of the Dwemer is the lost city of Arkngthamz-Phng. The element most engrained into its mythos, the almost singular thing it's known for, is its demise. Very little is remembered about what it was or how it came to be. Even its name has been obscured by the colorful moniker \"Fang Lair,\" a truncated adulteration of the original \"Phng\" paired with a suitably sinister descriptor for the home of its most infamous resident. You've undoubtedly heard some derivation of a legend retold over thousands of years, so it should suffice to say that the story of a Dragon taking roost in this formerly Dwarven city has sadly overshadowed the fascinating history that came before.  \n"
"\n"
"Thankfully, through my research, some aspects of this buried history can now be brought to light. My findings suggest that in the decades following the establishment of peace between the Chimer and Dwemer, Dwarves of Clan Kragen began to seek new holdings beyond Resdayn. Following the path laid out by the exiled Clan Rourken during their exodus, the Dwarves of Kragen reached what we now consider Skyrim and first established their presence in the region with the founding of Arkngthamz.\n"
"\n"
"It's unclear precisely what appealed so much to the Kragen explorers that it was worth settling among the hostile Nords, but in spite of regular attacks by the warlike Men, their city flourished. So much so that it encouraged other clans to expand their own holdings to the west. This loose alliance of clans effectively established a pocket empire of four city-states that were considered unassailable. Not that the Nords stopped trying.\n"
"\n"
"Perhaps it was this success, or the presence of so many nearby clans, that drove Clan Kragen to press on with their expansion west through the treacherous Dragon's Teeth Mountains, but I believe they sought to bridge their new empire with the their estranged cousins in Volenfell. Whatever the case, they broke stone for a sister city on the border of modern Hammerfell: Arkngthamz-Phng.\n"
"\n"
"Despite the inhospitable terrain, there is some evidence to suggest that the Dwarves aggressively carved out this burgeoning settlement, which soon supplanted its predecessor as the seat of Clan Kragen's power. Though greatly devastated, the expansive vaults of Arkngthamz-Phng's main hall are still majestic in their scale. It's easy to see how such a vast, secluded space, rich with resources and life, would be an attractive home for a Dragon seeking more well-appointed accommodations than those chiseled out by Nords in the service of the Dragon Priesthood. \n"
"\n"
"Sadly, my first expedition met unexpected resistance, forcing me to abandon the site before more significant revelations could be unearthed; however, I have no doubts that the interest garnered by this publication will see a second, more ambitious expedition come to fruition."

"Zaan the Scalecaller was a Dragon Priest of short life and little renown. She commanded no great battles, conquered no powerful enemies. At just a glance, one would think her unremarkable, unworthy of further inspection. Certainly that has been the viewpoint of historians up to this point, given the lack of academia written on her. However, the fact that Zaan's story has been so ignored is exactly what makes her such a fascinating subject.\n"
"\n"
"Zaan was uncommonly young when chosen by her Dragon Lord, the mighty Dovah Thurvokun. It is said that her connection to Thurvokun was particularly strong. As we know, there is much speculation on the connection between a Dragon and their chosen priest, whether it be spiritual, magical, or perhaps merely political. Whatever the case, Zaan grew a rapid and robust attachment, which her followers took as a sign of great fortune. For a decade or so, all was well.\n"
"\n"
"The turmoil began when Thurvokun left his temple, for reasons unknown to all but perhaps Zaan herself. By all accounts, it was this departure that led to the Dragon Priest's steady decline into a depressive state, though it is uncertain whether this was magically or psychologically induced. This depression brought about frequent seclusion, growing into a steady isolation.\n"
"\n"
"Her followers slowly grew discontent, and as time went by many became mistrustful. They believed that Thurvokun had abandoned them, and saw this with the despair that we today would see the loss of the Divines. They began to accuse Scalecaller of driving him away with her weakness. When confronted with these accusations, it is said that Scalecaller made no protest. Her followers took this as admittance, and killed her in their anger. \n"

"This leads us to Zaan's greatest mystery. When accused by her followers, why did she not defend herself?\n"
"\n"
"My theory, though mostly speculative, is that the Dragon Priest simply was not able. The loss of her Dragon Lord had brought upon such misery that she had lost her will, or perhaps even her ability, to speak. Again, whether this was brought upon by magical means or mere psychological trauma, I am still unsure. \n"
"\n"
"I believe through studying this historical occurrence we may gain further insight into the link between Dragon Priests and their Dragon Lords. We must look past the rudimentary political aspects of such a relationship, to see what lies beyond. What precisely was this spiritual connection, so highly revered? With Scalecaller's help, we can begin to answer that question."

"Jorvuld Davaux, 드래곤 프리스트 역사가에 의해\n"
"\n"
"Zalan Scalecaller는 짧은 삶과 작은 명성의 드래곤 프리스트였습니다. 그녀는 위대한 전투를하지 말고 강력한 원수를 물리 치지 않았습니다. 한 눈에, 그녀는 눈에 띄지 않으며, 더 이상 검사 할 가치가 없다고 생각할 것입니다. 물론 그것은 지금까지 역사가들의 견해였으며, 그녀에게 학계가 없다는 점을 감안할 때 분명합니다. 그러나 Zaan의 이야기가 너무도 무시 당했다는 사실은 그녀를 매력적인 주제로 만드는 것입니다.\n"
"\n"
"Zaan은 용의주 인 Dovah Thurvokun에 의해 선택 될 때 드문 것입니다. Thurvokun에 그녀의 연결이 특히 강했다는 것을 말한다. 우리가 알고 있듯이, 영적, 마법적 또는 정치적이든, 용과 선택된 사제와의 관계에 대한 많은 추측이 있습니다. 어떤 경우이든, Zaan은 신속하고 견고한 애착을 갖고 있었고, 그녀의 추종자들은 위대한 행운의 신호로 여겼습니다. 10 년 정도면 모든 것이 잘되었습니다.\n"
"\n"
"Thurvokun이 그의 사원을 떠날 때 혼란이 시작되었습니다. 이유는 아마도 Zaan 자신은 알 수 없기 때문입니다. 모든 기사에서 드래곤 프리스트가 우울한 상태로 꾸준히 쇠퇴하게 된 것은이 출발 이었지만 이것이 마술 적으로 또는 심리적으로 유도되었는지는 불확실합니다. 이 우울증으로 인해 쇄도가 빈번 해지고 꾸준히 고립되었습니다.\n"
"\n"
"추종자는 서서히 불만을 갖게되었고 시간이지나면서 많은 사람들이 불신했습니다. 그들은 Thurvokun이 그들을 포기하고 오늘날 우리가 신의 상실을 보게 될 절망과 함께 이것을 보았다고 믿었습니다. 그들은 Scalecaller가 그를 약점으로 몰아 냈다고 비난하기 시작했습니다. 이러한 비난에 직면했을 때, Scalecaller는 항의하지 않았다고합니다. 그녀의 추종자들은 이것을 받아 들여서 분노로 그녀를 죽였다.\n"
"\n"
"이것은 우리를 Zaan의 가장 큰 신비로 인도합니다. 그녀의 추종자들로부터 비난을 받았을 때 왜 그녀는 자신을 변호하지 않았는가?\n"
"\n"
"나의 이론은 비록 대부분 추측이지만 용의 성직자는 단순히 능력이 없다는 것입니다. 그녀의 드래곤로드의 손실은 그녀가 그녀의 의지를 잃었거나 심지어 그녀의 능력조차도 잃어버린 비참함을 가져 왔습니다. 다시 말하지만, 이것이 마법적인 수단이나 단순한 심리적 외상으로 인한 것이 든 나는 아직도 확신 할 수 없습니다.\n"
"\n"
"이 역사적 사건을 연구함으로써 드래곤 프리스트와 드래곤로드 간의 관계에 대한 더 깊은 통찰력을 얻을 수 있다고 생각합니다. 우리는 그러한 관계의 초보적인 정치적 측면을 지나쳐 무엇이 넘어야 하는지를 살펴 봐야합니다. 이 영적 연결은 정확히 무엇 때문에 매우 존경 받았습니까? Scalecaller의 도움으로이 질문에 대한 답변을 시작할 수 있습니다.-G-"

In fact, we don't even need campfires for more than cooking anymore, and maybe not even that. There are lava channels all through the area that keep the caverns and ruins nice and toasty. That probably explains why it's so lush too. You'd never expect to find so much growth this high in the mountains, much less vines nearly as thick as I am wide.\n"

There's construction in the heart of this ruin that would rival the ingenuity of the Ayleids, if not the Dwarves. The chamber is vast and appears to serve both practical and ritualistic functions, though I've only begun to discern what its purpose is. My present theory is that this place was a forge of some kind. It harnessed the power of these lava flows to smelt the tribe's ore and heat their metals.

"Fate is a strange thing. The path of one's fortune turns often and unpredictably, without any rhyme or reason to mortal minds, though the series of events that led me to this place speak to an intelligence arranging the scenes. Like so many great discoveries, this one was made by accident, leading me to believe Julianos has a mischievous streak.\n"
"\n"
"Hampered by delays, my expedition to Craglorn did not even begin until Frost Fall. A wiser person would have put off the trek for the next year, but I'd been held up long enough and let spite rule me. Fiery determination kept me warm through the first few nights ascending the Jerall Mountains, but like any savvy highwayman, the cold chose to rob me of that determination once I'd come too far to turn and flee.\n"
"\n"
"With little choice other than brave the nearest dry cave and pray that it was home to neither bear nor troll, I discovered a natural cavern extending some distance into the rock. I nearly leapt out of my skin as a chilling howl rolled through the stony interior, but it was only a stiff wind that tugged at my clothes in the darkness. Curious, I temporarily abandoned my search for the most comfortable patch of granite to bed down upon to search for the source.\n"
"\n"
"What I discovered was a secluded valley surrounded on all sides by the mountain, and that might have been the end of it, had the bear I'd blundered past not roused from its stupor. Weary as I was, the anger of the sluggish beast was more than enough incentive for me to brave the cold a little longer. Unlike the hinterlands along the mountain path, the wilderness I found myself in was still clinging to life in spite of the bitter cold. \n"
"\n"
"The land might have been weathering the chill with grace, but I was still likely to die of exposure without some form of shelter, so I soldiered on in search of a quiet nook to stuff my bedroll into. I thought I might collapse on more than one occasion, which would have certainly spelled death for me in this frigid clime, but my perseverance was rewarded soon enough. At the far end of the valley stood an ancient ruin, carved right from the mountain. Without the energy to marvel or the sense to concern myself with what dangers might lie within, I heaved the massive stone doors open with the last of my strength and collapsed into a heap. My last thoughts lingered on the gust of warm air that greeted me as I slipped out of consciousness. \n"
"\n"
"I woke to find myself face down, not on frigid stone, but warm earth and lush grass. At first I took the dampness of my clothes for thawed frost, but it was my sweat that had the cloth clinging to my skin. The ruins, it seemed, were constructed throughout a cavern filled with active lava flows coursing through it. I attempted to justify the presence of such vibrant plant life to myself as a symptom of the tropical warmth, but that excuse didn't hold up to scrutiny. Something about this place was causing the unusual growth and these ruins were either the cause, or likely built here because of the caverns unique properties.\n"
"\n"
"No longer at risk of dying from exposure, I settled in at the mouth of the cavern and studied the exterior of the ruin in great detail. They were Nedic in origin, that much was obvious to me, but less refined than other architecture I'd seen around Cyrodiil. Pre-Alessian, even. I could have spent months in Craglorn hunting for a find as significant as this, and I stumbled upon it—quite literally—barely a few days after embarking. Fate is a strange thing indeed."

"지연에 방해가되면, Craglorn에 대한 나의 원정은 서리가 내릴 때까지 시작되지 않았습니다. 더 현명한 사람은 내년을 위해 여행을 연기했을 것이다. 그러나 나는 충분히 길게 붙들 게되었고, 나를 지배하게했다. 불 같은 결단력으로 제럴 산맥을 오르는 처음 몇 밤을 따뜻하게 지켜주었습니다. 그러나 정통한 하이웨이 맨처럼 냉기는 돌아 서서 도망 가기에 너무 멀었을 때 저 결정을 저 버렸습니다.\n"
"\n"
"가장 가까운 건조한 동굴에 용감히 맞서기도하고 그것이 곰도 트롤도없는 집이 되길기도하면서, 나는 바위로 약간의 거리를 확장하는 자연의 동굴을 발견했습니다. 나는 거의 내 피부에서 뛰쳐 나와 차가운 울부 짖음이 돌이 많은 실내에서 굴러 갔지만 어둠 속에서 내 옷을 당긴 것은 딱딱한 바람이었습니다. 호기심, 나는 일시적으로 가장 편안한 화강암 조각에 대한 검색을 포기하고 소스를 검색했습니다.\n"
"\n"
"산에서 사방으로 둘러싸인 한적한 계곡이었습니다. 그 멍청한 놈에게서 나는 과거를 망쳤다. 나는 낡았지만, 느린 짐승의 분노는 감기를 조금 더 오래 용감하게 해주는 인센티브 이상이었습니다. 산길을 따라 펼쳐진 내륙과는 달리, 내가 겪은 광야는 끔찍한 추위에도 불구하고 여전히 삶에 매달리고있었습니다.\n"
"\n"
"그 땅은 은혜로 냉기를 풍겼을 수도 있었지만, 어떤 형태의 피난처 없이는 여전히 노출 될 가능성이 있었기 때문에 나는 조용한 구석을 찾아 내 장례식을 채우기 위해 땜질을했습니다. 나는 한 번 이상 붕괴 될 수도 있다고 생각했는데,이 추운 날씨에 나를 위해 죽음을 분명히 암시 할 수는 있었지만 내 인내는 곧 보상을 받았다. 계곡의 맨 끝에서 산에서 바로 조각 된 고대 파멸이 일어났다. 경이를 표할 에너지 나 내면의 위험성에 대해 걱정할 마음이 없었 으면 막강한 돌 문을 열어 내 힘을 다하여 무더기로 무너지게했습니다. 나의 마지막 생각은 내가 의식에서 빠져 나올 때 나를 맞이했던 따뜻한 공기의 돌풍에 머물렀다.\n"
"\n"
"나는 춥고 돌진하지 않고 따뜻한 땅과 무성한 풀밭을 내려다 보며 눈을 떴습니다. 처음에는 얼어 붙은 서리 때문에 제 옷의 습기를 가졌지 만, 옷이 내 피부에 달라 붙는 것은 땀이었습니다. 그 유적은 활발한 용암이 가득 찼던 동굴 전체에 건설되어 보였습니다. 나는 열대성 온난화의 징후로서 그러한 역동적 인 식물 생활의 존재를 나 자신에게 정당화하려고 시도했지만 그 변명은 정밀 조사를 견디지 ​​못했다. 이 장소에 대한 어떤 것이 비정상적인 성장을 일으키고 있었고 이러한 폐허가 원인 이었거나 동굴 고유의 특성 때문에 이곳에 지어 졌을 가능성이 큽니다.\n"
"\n"
"노출로 인해 죽을 위험에 더 오래 걸리지는 않았지만 동굴 입구에 정착했습니다. 파멸의 외관을 아주 자세히 연구했습니다. 그들은 Nedic의 원산지 였고, 그 정도는 나에게는 분명했지만, Cyrodiil에서 보았던 다른 건축물보다 덜 세련되었습니다. Pre-Alessian, 심지어. 나는 Craglorn 사냥에서 수개월을 걸려서 발견 할 수 있었고, 발굴 한 지 며칠 만에 문자 그대로 발견했습니다. 운명은 참으로 이상한 것입니다.-G-"

"The face I wear for my former allies is one of outrage. How dare we stand by and allow the Silken Ring to encroach on our territory. How dare we show weakness as they steal our contracts and kill our agents. My words stoke the fire as my knives provide the fuel and they are none the wiser. Indolent, arrogant, fools.\n"
"—\n"
"The Lady of Lace was pleased with my deception. The Morag Tong is chasing shadows, while the real threat mounts far from their notice. For my efforts, I have been invited to join the Silken Ring. Through them I will no longer merely pay lip service to Mephala, but do her bidding by my own hands. How can the promise of gold compare to reaping the blessings of the Daedra?\n"
"—\n"
"The Lady has asked one last thing of me before I may receive the blessings of the Spinner. An offering of devotion. A sacrifice befitting Mephala. Some other fool might be tempted to rush out and work their knife in her name. Not I. This requires care. My introduction must be perfect.\n"
"—\n"
"I have never desired ties. Why chain my heart to the weapons my enemies would wield against me? There have been moments though, where I have been handed those shackles and invited to clasp the lock closed. Nyri, was one such temptation. Perhaps it is now my turn to offer the bonds.\n"
"—\n"
"Nyri was unprepared for my advances, for good reason. I'd made my intentions clear before. I did not give her time to question my change of heart, as hers still harbored affection for me. Nyli's reason melted at my touch, and she has fallen into Mephala's web willingly.\n"
"—\n"
"I have whispered lies into Nyli's ear for many nights now. Seeded doubt in her mind about the Morag Tong. Convinced her that we should act without their sanction. I will lead her to the Silken Ring tonight. It will be perfect.\n"
"—\n"
"The look on Nyri's face as the dagger pierced her heart was exquisite. It was as if all the emotions she'd secreted away inside burst forth in one last agonizing torrent, before she died. The Lady of Lace was so moved by my sacrifice that I've caught her eye. As it should be.\n"
"—\n"
"I go now, into the Cradle of Shadows, to taste Mephala's true power. The reward for my devotion will be sublime.\n"
"—\n"
"This was that right move. I'm more sure of it than ever. Any doubts I had disappeared when I met the Lady of Lace. The power she offers is more than anything the fools back in Morrowind can imagine. One of many benefits gained from casting off the shackles of mortal whims to embrace a higher purpose. This is what the Morag Tong must have been before it became strangled by bureaucracy and beholden to false gods."

"The veil is thickest here, the boundary between us and the world above clings to everything, giving the darkness substance. It holds tightly in the absence of light, bringing with it a numbing cold. I find it comforting. \n"
"—\n"
"These caves are an ideal environment to tend for our kin. The Silken Ring offers tributes of blood as succor to the fledglings. Nestled in the shadow of their great mother, they will grow large and grow strong, until we release them back into the world.\n"
"—\n"
"I am truly blessed by the Spinner. My will calls out to the veil and it moves by my whim. I have woven it into my own web. Through it I can feel the skitter of our kin, the throb of the eggs, the terrified quivering of the prey tossed down for us. The Lady of Lace was wise to grant me this domain.\n"
"—\n"
"Now this is interesting. Something disturbs the calm of the shadows that I have not felt before. Intruders. They tug and tear at the snare with purpose, but will their strength endure or will it ebb away as my noose draws tighter? I find myself thrilled to find the answer."

"I did not think it possible, but Tsatva-Lan once again proves why he is the example we Shadowscales must follow. He has uncovered a lead on one of our most elusive enemies. The Silken Ring know all our tricks, making it all but impossible to deal with their growing aggression. Somehow Tsatva-Lan has found their lair. We must act quickly if we are to root them out before they realize we know where to find them.\n"
"—\n"
"I have been called upon to join Tsatva-Lan in our retribution against the Silken Ring. He plans for us to attack in force and purge the nest of our enemies. It is a rare thing to find so many Shadowscales directed to a single purpose. I will consider it a privilege to join in this slaughter for the glory of Sithis.\n"
"—\n"
"This will not be an easy task. Tsatva-Lan has confided in me that there is evidence that the Silken Ring have more than their skill as assassins to thank for their success. They have tapped into a tangible power that makes them more deadly than they ever were before deserting their comrades in the Dark Brotherhood, or Morag Tong. That is why he has chosen to bring so many others on this errand and why he needs me at his side. We cannot afford to be divided in purpose or place to overcome this threat.\n"
"—\n"
"Tonight we descend into the pit that our enemies call home. Tsatva-Lan admits that he knows little about what lies within, but his spines are aligned in confidence and eagerness. I too feel the siren song of our enemy's pulse, it acts as the drum beat of our march and the anticipation of its quickening before falling silent is intoxicating. I would pity the Silken Ring, if I knew how."

"Sap. That is what these thin-shelled fools call it. As if such a substance could ever be compared to Nirn-tainted resin. No, it is much more than sap.\n"
"\n"
"\"Amber Plasm.\" That is what one of the scholars called it before I fed him to Mighty Chudan. He said that it was like the chaotic creatia of Oblivion—leaking into Mundus through our Hist like blood from a wound. These dry-tongues and their airs—as if anyone could know the secrets of the Hist better than I!\n"
"\n"
"The plasm has accumulated at the roots of the Tsono-Xuhil since before the Saxhleel could lift a spade, but only I have discovered its secrets. Drinking it or bathing in it can drive a Saxhleel mad. But through alchemical study, and the Hist's guidance, I have learned to harness its power. This was no small feat. The creatia is a thing of chaos. The call to Sithis is in its nature. But we must remain deaf to his commands.  Those Saxhleel who call him father languish in mud huts and eat old fish from wooden bowls. The Xit-Xaht hear the call to order, and shall dwell in a shining city forever more!\n"
"\n"
"If properly manipulated, the Amber Plasm can grant a worthy Saxhleel great speed and strength. I am proof of its efficacy. Soon, my brew will be ready to distribute to all Xit-Xaht sons and daughters. Then Mazzatun will be a rival even to the Imperial City! The People of the Root will rule Black Marsh first, then all of Tamriel!"

"In the Marsh we pay little heed to the passing of the days. We leave such things to the Jekka-Wats. But, here in Mazzatun, we count the days and nights obsessively. We cannot help it. By last count, I have been trapped here for three months. When my tribe arrived, the Xit-Xaht pressed an iron pick into my hands and pointed at a pile of stones. No words, just a hunter's tongue-rattle and a gestured command.\n"
"\n"
"The Xit-Xaht do not talk much, but they never stop moving, and pointing, and whipping. It is like they are all sap-sick or addled on bad daril. After three months in captivity, I have begun to feel it too. The madness. The sap here is poison. The dirt is poison. Sithis is nothing but a memory here. All the order, and stacked-stones, and clean angles … they try to turn back the river by making us work. But this city is a prison for the Xit-Xaht as well. If not for Na-Kesh I think they would turn feral and wander off into the ruins to die. She is everywhere and nowhere. They say she is the mouth of the Hist—that she speaks for the Hist. If this is true, then this Hist is like none I've seen before. It is sick, and we all pay the price in blood."
