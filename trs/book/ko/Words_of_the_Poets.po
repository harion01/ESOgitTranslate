"And brought down the cruel, obscene spire.\n"

"Framed by hills in the wildest, forlorn place\n"

"Sits the barren bones of Abernanit.\n"
"\n"
"When thrice-blessed Rangidil first saw Abernanit,\n"
"It burnished silver bright with power and permanence.\n"
"A dreadful place with dreadful men to guard it\n"
"With fever glassed eyes and strength through the Horror.\n"
"Rangidil saw the foes' number was far greater\n"
"Than the few Ordinators and Buoyant Armigers he led,\n"
"Watching from the hills above, the field and castle of death\n"
"While it stood, it damned the souls of the people\n"
"Of Morrowind.\n"
"Accursed, iniquitous castle Abernanit.\n"
"\n"
"The alarum was sounded calling the holy warriors to battle\n"
"To answer villainy's shield with justice's spear,\n"
"To steel themselves to fight at the front and be brave.\n"
"Rangidil too grasped his shield and his thin ebon spear\n"
"And the clamor of battle began with a resounding crash\n"
"To shake the clouds down from the sky.\n"
"The shield wall was smashed and blood staunched\n"
"The ground of the field, a battle like no other\n"
"Of Morrowind\n"
"To destroy the evil of Abernanit.\n"
"\n"
"The maniacal horde were skilled at arms, for certes,\n"
"But the three holy fists of Mother, Lord, and Wizard pushed\n"
"The monster's army back in charge after charge.\n"
"Rangidil saw from above, urging the army to defend,\n"
"Dagoth Thras himself in his pernicious tower spire,\n"
"And knew that only when the heart of evil was caught\n"
"Would the land e'er be truly saved.\n"
"He pledge then by the Temple and the Holy Tribunal\n"
"Of Morrowind\n"
"To take the tower of Abernanit.\n"
"\n"
"In a violent push, the tower base was pierced,\n"
"But all efforts to fell the spire came to naught\n"
"As if all the strength of the Horror held that one tower.\n"
"The stairwell up was steep and so tight\n"
"That two warriors could not ascend it side by side.\n"
"So single-file the army clambered up and up\n"
"To take the tower room and end the reign\n"
"Of one of the cruelest petty tyrants in the annals\n"
"Of Morrowind,\n"
"Dagoth Thras of Abernanit.\n"
"\n"
"They awaited a victory cry from the first to scale the tower\n"
"But silence only returned, and then the blood,\n"
"First only a rivulet and then a scarlet course\n"
"Poured down the steep stairwell, with the cry from above,\n"
"\"Dagoth Thras is besting our army one by one!\"\n"
"Rangidil called his army back, every Ordinator and\n"
"Buoyant Armiger, and he himself ascended the stairs,\n"
"Passing the bloody remains of the best warriors\n"
"Of Morrowind\n"
"To the tower room of Abernanit.\n"
"\n"
"Like a raven of death on its aerie was Dagoth Thras\n"
"Holding bloody shield and bloody blade at the tower room door.\n"
"Every thrust of Rangidil's spear was blocked with ease;\n"
"Every slash of Rangidil's blade was deflected away;\n"
"Every blow of Rangidil's mace was met by the shield;\n"
"Every quick arrow shot could find no purchase\n"
"For the Monster's greatest power was in his dread blessing\n"
"That no weapon from no warrior found in all\n"
"Of Morrowind\n"
"Could pass the shield of Abernanit.\n"
"\n"
"As hour passed hour, Rangidil came to understand\n"
"How his greatest warriors met their end with Dagoth Thras.\n"
"For he could exhaust them by blocking their attacks\n"
"And then, thus weakened, they were simply cut down.\n"
"The villain was patient and skilled with the shield\n"
"And Rangidil felt even his own mighty arms growing numb\n"
"While Dagoth Thras anticipated and blocked each cut\n"
"And Rangidil feared that without the blessing of the Divine Three\n"
"Of Morrowind\n"
"He'd die in the tower of Abernanit.\n"
"\n"
"But he still poured down blows as he yelled,\n"
"\"Foe! I am Rangidil, a prince of the True Temple,\n"
"And I've fought in many a battle, and many a warrior\n"
"Has tried to stop my blade and has failed.\n"
"Very few can anticipate which blow I'm planning,\n"
"And fewer, knowing that, know how to arrest the design,\n"
"Or have the strength to absorb all of my strikes.\n"
"There is no greater master of shield blocking in all\n"
"Of Morrowind\n"
"Than here in the castle Abernanit.\n"

"My foe, dark lord Dagoth Thras, before you slay me,\n"
"I beg you, tell me how you know how to block.\"\n"
"Wickedly proud, Dagoth Thras heard Rangidil's plea,\n"
"And decided that before he gutted the Temple champion,\n"
"He would deign to give him some knowledge for the afterlife,\n"
"How his instinct and reflexes worked, and as he started\n"
"To explain, he realized that he did not how he did it,\n"
"And watched, puzzled, as Rangidil delivered what the tales\n"

"Sit my small fellows, as I spin you a tale of the beast cloaked in shadow, as a midsummer gale!\n"
"\n"
"With a face all athunder with fangs pearly white, he could fell a whole forest with one terrible bite!\n"
"\n"
"When he came, one fine eve, upon Wilding Run with a mind full of murder, oh such wonderful fun!\n"
"\n"
"To dizzy its people that treacherous night 'neath a star-spattered sky in the palest moonlight!\n"

"The Spinners came first, in this dreadful grim story, and the Treethane, his fate? Most assuredly gory!\n"

"All the guards in their bunks, tucked away in their beer! Torn apart in the night where no one could hear!\n"
"\n"
"As for me? I escaped from that hideous fate, though the beast, he gave chase all the way to the gate!\n"
"\n"
"How he yelled, how he stamped 'til I barely could see! All his rage, all his bluster 'neath the twisted old tree.\n"
"\n"
"After that? Who can guess! I know none who could tell of the others, all slain in that terrible quell.\n"
"\n"
"But I tell you, my friend, 'fore I leave you this day—if you ever do journey up that wilding way…\n"
"\n"
"Keep your eyes to the road, do not waver! Don't hedge! Do not go in the wood! Do not stray near its edge!\n"
"\n"
"Lest he catch you up quick in his terrible gaze and you find yourself faced with the end of your days!"
