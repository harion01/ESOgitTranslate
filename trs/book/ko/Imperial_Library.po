"My name is Glyndallagan, and this is my confession.\n"
"\n"
"I should begin at the beginning—as if there were such a thing. I came to the city as a mage of modest means. Nothing but holes in my pockets, and a rattling cart full of knickknacks. I suppose you could consider me a con-man. My game was simple: lure affluent, small-minded people to my cart and make a wager. \"I bet you—\" I said, \"I bet you I can turn whatever you have in your pocket into an apple.\" Of course it wasn't always apples. It could be a thimble, or a button, or an old shoe. Inevitably, they would bite and take up the bet. I would cast a simple translocative spell, whisking their item into my cart, and replacing it with whatever garbage I had managed to gather up the day before. Such a transfer is child's-play when compared to an actual transmutation. Thus, my gain was two-fold: I acquired whatever item they happened to be carrying around, as well as the balance of the wager. This earned me a decent living for a while. Until I ran into the Rattle-Man.\n"
"\n"
"He was tall, certainly—and very, very thin. And when he walked, his coin-purse made an unnerving clatter. A rattling of what sounded like bone on bone. I didn't have to flag him down, or lay out my pitch. He simply reached into his pocket and produced a handful of random objects. Teeth, bone chips, glowing shards …. His silence was unsettling, and the items were so random and macabre I could barely keep my composure. But I was greedy then. Greedy, and foolish. \n"
"\n"
"He eventually spoke in a low, rasping voice, \"Shall we make a wager?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Of course!\" I said. \"Eight drakes for eight trinkets!\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Make it fifty drakes if you succeed. And if you fail ….\" he replied.\n"
"\n"
"A fifty drake wager! It took me a moment to process this. I had never even considered the results of a failure. \"Well, if I fail, I suppose I'll owe you fifty drakes.\" This seemed to rub him the wrong way. He put the items in his pocket and turned to leave.\n"
"\n"
"Even now, I will wake from a dead sleep, gasping over the horror of this moment. Reliving it in my mind, over and over. If I had just let him walk away. If I had been distracted by another mark, or taken my lunch early, all of this might have been avoided. But as I said, I was greedy and foolish. I shouted over his shoulder, \"What would you have instead, sir?\"\n"
"\n"
"He turned on his heel and smiled. At least I think it was a smile. I don't remember his face, you see? No one ever remembers his face. He spoke in a whisper, \"I only want a vow that you'll return the items to me when the trick is done.\"\n"
"\n"
"He knew my game. No corner-cob hustler would weave a transmutation spell for five drakes. He knew I just took the items into my cart via a translocation cantrip. So why worry? I would simply reach into my cart and hand him the items after the spell was cast. There was a fear in the pit of my stomach, but I took his clammy, pale hand in mine and shook on it. \"You have my vow,\" I said. And with those four words, my fate was sealed.\n"
"\n"
"I cast the translocation spell as normal. There was a brilliant flash of light, and a puff of colorful smoke. All according to plan. And just as I expected, his handful of terrifying trinkets had been \"transformed\" into a handful of buttons, bent silverware, and scraps of shoe leather.\n"
"\n"
"\"Excellent.\" he rasped. \"Now, if I could have my items back, we can conclude our wager.\"\n"
"\n"
"I was elated. Fifty drakes! Fifty drakes for a small-time hustle. I was practically dancing when I opened the cart. But something was wrong. All my items were gone. Everything. I searched everywhere—my pockets, inside the cart, the street beneath. Nothing. \"It appears that you have failed,\" he said. \n"
"\n"
"And thus began my endless service to the Rattle-Man. I will search for his missing items for the rest of my days.\n"
"\n"
"My life is a curse. My nights are filled with bad dreams, my days with waking terrors. My bones strain and creak. My hair grows thinner and paler by the day. All for a handful of bone scraps and teeth.\n"
"\n"
"So, I make this compact with you, dear reader. Bring me your frightful trinkets—your bone scraps and bloody claws. Bring them to my trophy vaults, and I will grant you riches beyond imagining. Do not trouble yourself with thoughts of where these riches came from. I have had to become very … resourceful. Scruples are a luxury that the cursed cannot afford. No, only the trinkets matter. \n"
"\n"
"Perhaps one day I will find all of the Rattle-Man's trinkets. And on that day, I will kill myself and leave this accursed world behind."

"On the Nature of Tel Var Stones, Vol. IV\n"
"by Herminius Sophus\n"
"The Conclusive Nature of Tel Var Stones:\n"
"\n"
"The first thing to be gleaned from this weighty work, is a keen grasp of the connection between the Tel Var Stones themselves and the many unique applications of Magic. Physically, they appear to be unblemished stones of undeniable magical radiance—but when examined by an an educated mind, it is clear that they are somehow imbued with more magical power than any other such objects that have yet been studied. One could speculate that the Ayleids could not produce such power themselves, so perhaps they mined these stones without substantial modification from a long emptied quarry of magical concentrate. Or perhaps they tapped into a nexus of interwoven magical threads from beyond Nirn. Or perhaps they created this material from the works, or even corpuses, of long deceased scholars. All of these hypotheses are just that, and should not be considered fact without further evidence. The methods described within Volume 2 are but one way of discovering the effluvia of Magic mixt with the Stone. There may still be others. Dwemer contraptions designed to investigate such magical phenomena are known to have once existed. An instrument of such technological sophistication might yield more data concerning the origin of these Tel Var Stones, and ultimately how these Stones may be useful for further academic experimentation."

"텔 바 스톤의 확실한 본질:\n"
"\n"
"이 중대한 작업에서 얻을 수 있는 첫 번째 사실은, 텔 바 스톤 그 자체와 수많은 마법의 독특한 작용 사이의 연관성에 대한 강한 확신이다. 물리적으로 보면 텔 바 스톤은 마법의 광채라고는 전혀 찾아볼 수 없는 것처럼 보이지만, 교육받은 지성으로 검사해보면 왜 그런지는 몰라도 지금껏 연구되었던 그 어떤 물체보다도 마법적인 힘에 물들어 있는 것을 알 수 있다. 에일리드는 이러한 힘을 스스로 만들어낼 수 없었기 때문에 마법 농축물의 채석장에서 이 돌들을 큰 수정을 가하지 않은 채 모조리 캐냈을지도 모른다. 아니면 넌 너머에 엮여져 있는 마법적인 실의 연결체에 접근했을지도 모른다. 아니면 오래 전에 죽었던 학자들의 작업물에서, 심지어는 그들의 시체에서 이 물질을 만들어냈을지도 모를 일이다. 이 모든 가설은 단지 가설일 뿐이고, 추가적인 증거 없이는 사실이라고 생각하면 안 된다. 2권에 기술된 방법은 돌에서 악취나는 마법 혼합물을 발견하기 위한 방법의 하나일 뿐이다. 밝혀지지 않은 사실들이 더 있을지도 모른다. 이러한 마법적 현상을 조사하기 위해 고안된 드웨머 기계장치가 이미 존재한다고 알려져 있다. 그런 기술적인 정교함을 가진 기구는 이 텔 바 스톤의 기원, 그리고 궁극적으로는 이 돌들이 어떻게 학술적인 실험에 유용하게 쓰일 수 있을지에 대한 더 많은 자료를 산출해낼지도 모를 일이다."

"On the Nature of Tel Var Stones, Vol. III \n"
"by Herminius Sophus\n"
"An Observation of Tel Var Stones and the Schools of Magic:\n"
"\n"
"I am certain that all true alchemists will agree that the quality of the prepared Tel Var paste yielded from the rendering process outlined in Volume II of this treatise is of the highest caliber ever studied. Even the most benighted novice must conclude that the Ayleidoon conglomerate rendered by this experiment contains a unique and powerful form of raw magicka. With this assertion firmly established as fact, we shall proceed to the specific properties of the Tel Var slurry.\n"
"\n"
"The most apparent (and seemingly unsettling to the less educated) property is the enduring warmth of the paste and the steady blush of brilliantly pure light from each granular crystal. This, of course, suggests strong connections to both illusion and restoration. When the now sullied water has been filtered from the thick suspension, the nature of its power can also be made manifest by placing a piece of Orichalcum upon its surface. The mineral will appear to levitate—a clear indication of alteration potential. If examined closely, one should take note that the water has become a solution of a great number of minute white crystals. These particulates often clump together in clots that vibrate in the same manner as conjuring stones. If the slurry itself is combined with any other alchemical property, it may cause localized slowness and weakness to all manner of elemental impairments; an undeniable display of destructive power. Finally, if the Tel Var vapor removed from the alembic in the preceding recipe is examined separately with a single, taut blast of any Destruction spell, the vapor itself seems to reflect this simple affront; a clear property of mysticism. This leads us to the undeniable conclusion that all elements of Magical practice reside within these stones."

"\n"
"나는 진정한 연금술사라면 누구나 본 논문의 2권에서 서술된 과정을 통해 생성된 텔 바 반죽의 품질이 지금껏 연구된 것 중 최고라는 사실에 동의할 것이라고 확신한다. 가장 무지몽매한 초보자일지라도 이 실험으로 만들어진 에일리둔 집성체가 독특하고 강력한 날것의 매지카를 함유하고 있다는 판단을 내릴 수 밖에 없는 것이다. 이 주장이 확고한 사실로써 인정되었으니, 우리는 이 걸쭉한 텔 바 혼합물의 구체적인 성질을 알아볼 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"가장 명백한(그리고 교육을 덜 받은 자들에게는 불안해 보이는) 성질은 반죽에 오랫동안 남아있는 온기와 각각의 수정 알갱이에서 지속적으로 나오는 찬란하고 순수한 붉은 빛이다. 물론 이것은 환영과 회복 양쪽에 대한 강한 연관성을 암시한다. 또한 더럽혀진 물을 굵은 부유물로부터 여과해 내면, 표면에 오리칼쿰 조각을 배출하는 것으로써 그 힘의 본질을 드러낸다. 무기물은 공중에 떠오르는 것처럼 보일 것인데, 분명히 변이의 잠재력을 암시하는 것이다. 더 자세히 검사해 보면, 물에서 엄청난 양의 극미세한 흰색 수정이 분리되었다는 것을 주목할 수 있을 것이다. 이 미립자는 종종 소환석과 똑같은 방식을 통해 함께 진동하는 덩어리로 응집된다. 만약 혼합물 그 자체가 다른 연금술적인 특성과 결합된다면, 속성 손상의 방식과 완전히 같은 국부적인 둔화와 약화를 야기할 수 있다. 명백하게 파괴의 힘에서 보여지는 그것 말이다. 마지막으로, 이전 제조법에서 별도의 실험을 위해 증류기로 분리해냈던 텔 바 증기를 아무 파괴 주문으로 깔끔하게 폭발시킨다면, 증기 그 자체가 이 단순한 훼손, 즉 신비학의 투명한 속성을 반영하는 것처럼 보인다. 이것은 모든 속성의 마법적인 요소가 이 돌에 존재한다는 명백한 결론으로 우리를 이끌어준다."

"The preparation of the Tel Var Stones shall be performed thusly:\n"
"\n"
"Grind a Tel Var Stone in any mortar and pestle in whatever quantity you please. Add filtered water and distill it in an alembic of expert and scholarly make, separating the vapor for separate study. Pour the powdery soup into a calcinator of inferior quality, and only such, as the natural vugginess of the ramekin made from simple materials will prevent the entire mixture from turning to ash. Stir and clear it with an iron ladle, gathering together the whitish curds that swim at the top like rendered fat. When the color of the water is clear no longer (and, in fact, emits a rather odd glow) strew upon it auripigmentum powder equivalent to the initial quantity of the Tel Var Stone powder, plus about as much realgar as will lie upon a half Dwemer coin piece of eighteen or twenty pebble weight. After the auripigmentum and realgar have wed, stir in a capsule of crimson nirnroot powder as well. The powder will flash and glow. When the glow subsides, take out the now iridescent curds with a ladle having a lip or notch in the brim for regimented measurement, and release precisely half of the mixture into a master alchemist retort. Extract a few small drops of the remaining liquid and allow it to trickle out of the dropper into a separate phial of purified water. Please note: if these driblets are round and without tails, then there is not enough Tel Var within—likely due to insufficient heat. If this indeed the case, the recipe is lost, and the magicka held in stasis has been released without study. \n"

"(Note that if your assistant is of simple and superstitious mind, this failure may evoke a gentle weeping, as they may believe that some of the essence of Creation has been lost. This is, of course, not the case. You should give your assistant a stern rebuke, as any tolerance of this belief will only foster further ignorance.)"

"First, a warning to fellow alchemists: this recipe was developed under my careful scrutiny—the product of countless hours of study and experimentation. While the credit is unquestionably mine, I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge my unschooled but gentle servant, Azei at-Owynok. While a capable student, Azei suffers from some foolish notions about Tel Var stones. He repeatedly warned me against destroying these objects, citing some ridiculous connection to the Divines, or to Creation itself. Such speculation is rubbish, clearly unfounded, and should not color anyone's experimentation on these stones.\n"
"\n"
"As to the recipe itself, it is imperative that all steps are heeded without deviation. I am certain of their outcome only when performed by one of my immaculate brilliance. If incompetent hands attempt this, the outcome may be unstable. Such are the risks in our estimable profession!"

"\n"
"All right, lad. Arentus tells me you burst into the Undertaker's office in a tizzy because you spied a ghost outside the crematorium or some such. You're new to the work, so I'll spare you a tongue-lashing. The truth is you'll see a lot of \"ghosts\" here in the Memorial District. The good news is they aren't spooks. They're just plain old grave-robbers. These damned Khajiit cover themselves in flour then scamper around all night looking for trinkets. It would be funny if it weren't such a pain in the arse cleaning up after them.\n"
"\n"
"\"What are they looking for\" you ask? Well, you were just a twinkle in your old mum's eye at the time, but this place used to be a market. A damn fine one at that—the best in Cyrodiil. Used to be full of people haggling over spices, and bolts of silk, and fine jewelry. Wish you could have seen it. Anyway, when Varen showed up with his Colovian troops, Leovic's legion made their last stand here. I was still a pup at the time, you see? Spent the better part of a week tucked away in a sewer pipe waiting for it to stop. It was a week solid of sleeping on wet cobblestones and drinking bloody sewer water—hearing nothing but shouting, and clanging steel, and explosions that damn near rattled the teeth out of my head. By the time it was all over, the whole district was gone. And I mean, gone. Wasn't a single thing standing taller than my knee, and I was just nine or ten. Then there were the bodies. Hundreds of them. Thousands maybe. I hope I never have to smell something like that again. Smelled like that dog you dug out from under Elliana's carriage, except you couldn't get away from it. It was everywhere.\n"
"\n"
"Soon as Varen tossed old Leovic in the gutter, he set his men to work gathering up all the bodies and throwing them in mass graves. By the time he was done, there wasn't room for a market anymore. So he converted the whole district into a graveyard. The Memorial District.\n"
"\n"
"But enough with the history lesson—back to the Khajiit. They've got this fool notion that there are still jewels and such scattered throughout the district. I'll tell you right now, if there were still valuables here, I would have found them. And if I found them, I sure as spit wouldn't still be here turning a spade.\n"
"\n"
"Tomorrow, I want you to go to old-man Varus' house. Buy a good, strong bow. Next time you see a \"ghost\" put an arrow in its arse, and see if it sticks. Bet you ten drakes it shrieks like a housecat that got its tail stuck in a door.\n"

"It is with great pride that I report we have finally found the city's legendary Centrata! As you know, the city's underground is a complex nest of sewer drains and crumbling Ayleid ruins. We've always assumed that there was a grand design in their construction, but lacked the requisite resources to prove it. Now, with help from Chancellor Tharn and the wise Mannimarco, we've been able to delve deeper than we ever thought possible.\n"
"\n"
"Our survey indicates that all channels and passages eventually lead to the Centrata, a massive underground chamber that houses the White-Gold Tower's foundation. I can tell you, it is quite a sight to behold. The Tower rests on a stone monopile, supported by six massive vaults. The significance of this discovery cannot be overstated. It confirms countless architectural theories about the six districts' connections to the Tower and the age of the city's infrastructure. It might also grant us valuable insights into the nature of the White-Gold Tower and its power over Nirn.\n"
"\n"
"I would like to conduct a more thorough investigation, but our esteemed benefactor Mannimarco has declared the area off-limits. I do not mean to sound ungrateful. Without his help we never would have found the Centrata. But we still have a great deal to learn about how the chamber was constructed. I hope that the Elder Council might intercede on our behalf.\n"

"\n"
"Daedrology is a science born of catastrophe. Our greatest discoveries are always written down on charred parchment by an unsteady hand—and so it is with me. The Planemeld has dramatically enhanced our understanding of the Daedra, but at great cost. I can only hope that my work will survive this latest disaster.\n"
"\n"
"I believe that I am the first to write about Molag Bal's elite vanguard, the Xivkyn. The term \"Xivkyn\" is, of course, heavily Cyrodilicized—a crude portmanteau referencing their resemblance to both Xivilai and Dremora. And in fact, they are a hybrid race \"bred\" by Molag Bal to be his personal guard. They refer to themselves by many names; Stolavryk, Khimrykif, or Vyrsago depending on the hour. While they detest all mortal races, they reserve a particular hatred for their confederates, the Dremora. Xivkyn appear to place great emphasis on loyalty, making the Dremora's defection from Mehrunes Dagon an unforgivable sin.\n"
"\n"
"Of all the Daedra, Xivkyn are the most like Molag Bal. They share his unquenchable thirst for mortal souls and his obsession with the acquisition of soul gems. This drive to \"collect\" strikes me as a kind of madness, akin to those suffering from advanced vampirism. While I've never witnessed a physical confrontation between Xivkyn, they routinely scheme against one another in an attempt to gain more soul gems. These plots are commonplace and rarely result in censure from higher ranking Daedra. \n"
"\n"
"Despite the intrigues, the Xivkyn maintain a rigid code of military efficiency. Their fierce loyalty to Molag Bal combined with their physical and arcane might make them the most terrifying arrival since the Daedric Titan. While I'm sure there's much more to learn, I'm ready for this particular study to end."

"Mysteries of the Sublime Brazier\n"
"by Augusta Purusius, Associate Historian, Imperial Academy of Records and Histories\n"
"\n"
"In the brilliant dawn of St. Alessia's rule, Akatosh, the Dragon-God of Time, bestowed upon her many gifts: wisdom, temperance, vitality, and eventually the Amulet of Kings. The Amulet's role in maintaining Akatosh's compact with men and mer is well-known. Less well-known is the nature of its counterpart, The Sublime Brazier.\n"
"\n"
"The Brazier is an expertly wrought cauldron, carved to resemble a roost of dragons. Legends say that the bottom of the cauldron reaches down into the very heart of Nirn, and that the hewn dragons whisper to each other in a long-dead tongue when no one is near. As to its purpose—the Brazier serves as Akatosh's first light. When kindled, it brings life to the Dragonfires in the city above.\n"
"\n"
"The Brazier's location is a closely guarded secret. Some say that Alessia's heirs can hear it calling to them through Aethereal \"songs.\" This belief has guided many misguided souls into the sewers. The prideful and insane who believe themselves to be Dragonborn descend into the underground, straight into the waiting jaws of the many creatures that lurk there.  But then, this may be the true purpose of the Brazier—to test the strength and guile of any person who would be Emperor. The Imperial Sewers do not suffer fools. If you do not hear the songs, do not seek the Brazier."

"My velvety sweet—Ezudash forgives you for slapping him, and stepping on his tail, and hitting him in the face with your bailiff club. It was wrong of this one to send word of an arsonist in the stock house. But what can be said? Ezudash is foolish and impulsive in matters of the heart. And there was some truth in my story. When you arrived, you lit a great fire in Ezudash's loins. The heat is unbearable, my vivacious honey pot. It must be smothered, yes? \n"
"\n"
"You needn't deny your urges. Why keep pretending? You are a spirited maiden, Ezudash is a vigorous knave. This is a tale as old as Jone and Jode, yes? The story begins with reticence, yes, but ends in long nights of passionate grooming and eager love-wrestling. \n"
"\n"
"You may protest, yes. You may call Ezudash names, and write warrants for his arrest. But in your heart and your haunches, you feel the longing. This one has seen it! The wetted lips, the flush snout, the bristling fur on the small of your back. Even as you kick him, Ezudash sees the straining of your thighs, the lusty curl of your tail. Your desire is unmistakable. \n"
"\n"
"Meet me tonight in the Arboretum at sunset, my fiery love-kitten. The criers say it will be a hot night. A humid night. Perfect weather for a lively game of \"hide the mutton,\" yes? This one will be waiting underneath the juniper tree with a bottle of spiced wine … and nothing else.\n"

"Meeting in the Council Chamber in the White-Gold Tower. \n"
"\n"
"Council members in attendance: Chief Councilor Lovidicus, Councilor Faleria, Councilor Jirich, Councilor Abor, Councilor Itinia. Absent: Empress Regent Clivia Tharn, Chancellor Abnur Tharn, Advisor Mannimarco, Councilor Vandacia.\n"
" \n"
"Also attending: General Nipia of the 2nd Legion, High Magistrate Muspidus, Ambassador Linyedil of the Summerset Isles, and Ambassador Jadier Plourde of High Rock.\n"
"\n"
"Old affairs:\n"
"Councilor Jirich reports that recently enacted policies concerning animal waste have improved conditions in the Elven Gardens.\n"
"\n"
"Councilor Itinia reports that the decision in the last council meeting to delay this year's Legionary's Ball until 1st of Sun's Height have been met with widespread approval. Ambassador Linyedil confirms that the new date will ensure that the silks from Skyhold will now arrive in time to give all the attendees ample time to commission new attire.\n"
"\n"
"Though not attending, a letter from Councilor Vandacia indicates he has elected to remain in Gideon where he believes he can be more effective in helping manage the iron crisis in the Nibenay Basin.\n"
"\n"
"New affairs:\n"
"Chief Concilor Lividicus notes for the record that this month's balance sheet indicates that discretionary spending by the Empress Regent and her advisors has increased seven-fold over the annual expenditures from Emperor Varen's reign. The Chief Councilor makes a motion that General Nipia send an armed escort and forcibly ensure that Advisor Tharn attends the next council meeting. General Nipia strongly advises against such a course of action. The matter is held to a vote and the motion is denied.\n"
"\n"
"After the vote, Councilor Abor says she's feeling ill, possibly from ingesting spoiled mudcrab in this morning's brunch at the Temple of the Divines. Councilor Abor excuses herself from the meeting.\n"
"\n"
"Ambassador Jadier Plourde again petitions the council to order the Seventh Legion to withdraw from Bangkorai immediately. Councilor Jirich makes a motion for the matter to be raised with the Legionary's Council. The matter is held to a vote and affirmed. Chief Councilor Lovidicus asks General Nipia to raise the matter the next time the Legionary's Council convenes. The general says it's not scheduled to convene again until First Seed of next year, but he promises to raise the matter at that time.\n"
"\n"
"General Nipia informs the council that rumors continue to circulate about a conspiracy of traitors within the Imperial Legions. He requests that the council provide funds for his lieutenants to conduct a thorough internal investigation. No councilor volunteers to make a motion.\n"
"\n"
"General Nipia wants to speak about the matter in greater detail, but his statement is interrupted by a series of significant groundquakes. Captain Norbanus of the Imperial City Guard enters the council chamber to report that a \"Dark Anchor\" has descended just outside the city and that several Daedra have been spotted in the Nobles District.\n"
"\n"
"Due to this report, Councilor Faleria makes a motion that the council meeting be adjourned so the situation can be assessed. The motion is held to a vote and affirmed, but Chief Councilor Lovidicus vetoes the motion.\n"
" \n"
"Chief Councilor Lovidicus says the council meeting cannot be adjourned until a vote has been held on High Magistrate Muspidus's request to add Metheglin Perfume to the water supply in the sewers to help alleviate the city-wide stench believed to have been caused by the extra week of feasting during Rain's Hand this year. Councilor Itinia makes a motion to add the perfume. The motion is held to a vote and affirmed. \n"
"\n"
"Councilor Faleria again makes a motion to adjourn the meeting. The motion is held to a vote and affirmed. This meeting of the Elder Council is adjourned."

"Another of my cellmates dead. Typical. There are few mortals with the strength of body, of character, to survive here. But I will add young Vayron to the throne (when the masters have finished with his flesh), to serve me when my own body grows weary.\n"

The Daedra waste nothing, and under them, everyone has a role. Even if that role is serving at the front of a war chariot. As an ornament."

"We are doomed. The Gray Vipers, the Imperial City, the very Empire—all of us. The Daedra cannot be stopped. All that they do they do from impulse. And it is hideous.\n"
" \n"
"Years from today, if anyone remains to find this parchment, they may glean irony in a Gray Viper lamenting his fate after a lifetime of debauchery and criminality. But what I've done as a Viper was in the name of survival. Flourishing as it was before the Daedra invasion, this scholar-in-training found Imperial City didn't provide for everyone. The Gray Vipers allowed me to provide for myself.\n"
" \n"
"These Daedra, however … they kill us, maim us, infect us with demonic disease, and are enlivened by it. It's an art to them, a creative outlet, to cause agony. And when they run out of mortal bodies to disfigure they venture above to get more. It will be my turn soon, and I would deny whatever grotesque fate they craft for me.\n"
"\n"
"So I've started a collection. Just scraps of rope and cloth, here and there, pillaged from the bodies we pass when we're marched out of these cells to be paraded and whipped for the Lord Warden's pleasure. By week's end, I'll have enough for a way out of this place."

"The Daedra have overwhelmed the Prison. They run it now, led by a massive creature made from darkness, and carried on great wings. \n"
"\n"
"But it is about his lieutenant that I write. The \"Flesh Sculptor\" they call him, a powerful necromancer. It is at his behest that citizens are taken here, and harvested. The Sculptor has mastered devilry that allows him to turn mortal organs into carriers for plague and disease—flesh devices that spew noxious clouds to contaminate the earth around them. Their plan is to deploy a thousand of these slaughter engines, dispersed throughout the City.\n"
