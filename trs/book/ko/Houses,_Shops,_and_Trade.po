"First of all, it takes years for all the meat and bugs to fall in. And they have to fall naturally. Crosswings have a fierce bitterness when they die afraid. \n"
"\n"
"Then, you must stretch seventeen strings of the thinnest Alfiq-gut over each barrel. Press aged meat onto the strings, being careful not to let any fall before it has properly rotted. Then dust the meat with the finely chopped skins of the red-striped frog to make sure the crosswings are drunk and happy when they hit the drink. \n"
"\n"
"You do this every month for three or more years, until you have enough meat and bugs to fill the barrel. And that's not even counting the enchantments. You must have spells to attract the crosswings and mimics. And spells to keep out the flipbacks, tree-hoppers, and hoarvor larvae. \n"
"\n"
"There are spells to encourage the green mold and prevent the brown and white molds. Then you have to seal the barrel for nine or more years until the last of the green mold turns. Good thing we have long lives, eh?\n"

"So many people simply buy the items they need at the price they are given. It's a sad state of affairs, when the game is really open to all, you don't need an invitation. It is a game: the game of bargaining to be played seriously and, I hasten to add, politely. In Elsweyr, it is common for the shop owner to offer the prospective buyer tea or sweetmeats and engage in polite conversation before commencing business. This eminently civilized tradition has a practical purpose, allowing the buyer to observe the wares for sale. It is considered impolite not to accept, though it does not imply obligation on the part of the buyer.\n"
"\n"
"Whether this particular custom is part of the culture or not, it's wise for the buyer and seller to greet one another with smiles and warm salutations, like gladiators honoring one another before the battle.\n"
"Bargaining is expected all over Tamriel, but the game can be broken if one's offer is so preposterously low that it insults the shopkeeper. If you are offered something for ten gold pieces, try offering six and see where that takes you.\n"
"\n"
"Do not look like you are very interested, but do not mock the quality of the goods, even if they deserve it. It is much better to admire the quality of workmanship, but comment that, regretfully, you simply cannot afford such a price. When the shopkeeper compliments your taste, smile, try to resist the flattery.\n"
"\n"
"A lot of the game depends on recognizing the types of shopkeepers. Do not automatically assume that the rural merchant is ignorant and easily fooled or that the rapacious city merchant is selling shoddy merchandise. Caravans, it should be mentioned, are always good places to go to buy or trade.\n"
"\n"
"Knowing what you're buying and who you're buying from is a talent bought only after years of practice. Know the specialties of certain regions and merchants before you even set foot in a shop. Recognize the prejudices of the region. In Morrowind, where I hail from, Argonians are viewed with a certain amount of suspicion. Don't be surprised or insulted if the shopkeepers follow you around the shop, assuming you're going to steal something. Similarly, Nords, Bretons, and Cyrodiils are sometimes treated coolly by merchants in the Summerset Isles. Of course, I don't know any shopkeepers anywhere, no matter their open-mindedness, who aren't alerted when a Khajiit or a Bosmer enters their shop. Even Khajiiti and Bosmeri shopkeepers are wary of their own kind.\n"
"\n"
"If you see something you really like or need, buy it then and there at the best price you can get. I cannot tell you how many times I passed up a rare and interesting relic, assuming that I could find it elsewhere in the region, perhaps at a larger town at a better price. Too late, I discovered I was wrong. When I returned to the shop weeks later, the item I wanted was gone. Better to get a great purchase at a decent price and discover it again at a worse price than to miss out on your opportunities for ownership. Occasionally, impulsiveness is the best buying strategy.\n"
"\n"
"Sense the moves of the game, and everyone can win."

"I have received your request to be reassigned outside the mine for the remainder of your indentured servitude. I was tempted to reject your request out-of-hand, as I have your last three requests. It is not my fault your wife misses you or that the mine \"takes your breath away\" when you work. I did not accrue the debt you owe, and it is not my responsibility to give you a cushy way to work it off.\n"
"\n"
"However, I find myself in need of a small favor. One of the Goblins, a \"chief\" of theirs, has taken to rabble-rousing among the workers. I want to show him who runs the mining effort, and I'd like you to do something for me. The chief is seldom seen without a feather-colored trinket, a \"totem\" of little value, but something I'm sure he prizes, in his own primitive way.\n"
"\n"
"Steal it from him and bring it back to me, and I'll forgive your debt. I'm sure the Goblins will see how petty their \"chief\" is once he misses his trinket, and all will be well again in the mine.\n"

"Regarding: Mine Costs, Workers\n"
"\n"
"Against my better judgment, I've followed your orders and compiled the following report on mining operations costs, specifically regarding worker costs.\n"
"\n"
"Trained Miner: 15 gold/day, plus 10 gold/day rations\n"
"Argonian Miner: 10 gold/day, plus 8 gold/day rations\n"
"General Worker: 8 gold/day, 8 gold/day rations\n"
"Indentured Servant: 0 gold/day, 4 gold/day rations. Oversight: 1/10 gold day\n"
"Goblin: 0 gold/day, 1 gold/day rations. Oversight: unknown\n"
"\n"
"Trained miners and Argonians produce about the same amount of quality work per day, which is at least double that of a general worker's output. Indentured servants' output varies wildly, but on a long-term basis, they seldom produce more on average than a general worker and almost never remain with the mine after their period of indenture ends.\n"
"\n"
"Goblins are a wild card. So far, they dig like maniacs and have absolutely no interest in anything they pull out of the mine (see my other notes on Employee Theft), and they work for scraps. But I have heard rumblings, particularly from their shamans. They are unpredictable, and I suggest we use them sparingly and only for short periods of service."

"If you want to understand the essential philosophy of House Hlaalu, examine its coat of arms. Behold the scale: it represents balance, trade, and compromise. These essential concepts influence everything the House seeks to accomplish and directs its activities.\n"
"\n"
"Strive for balance in all things. When the scale tips to one side or the other, someone or something gets short-changed. When someone gets short-changed, unpredictability and strife unbalance the world around us. This idea must be embraced by every member of the House. To achieve freedom from greed, from want, and from strife, all parties in any exchange must find balance.\n"
"\n"
"Trade is the House's weapon, its tool, and its way. The House thrives when value and profit flows between supply and demand. House Hlaalu seeks to maintain open trade with anyone who would engage in honest business. Not even a lowly Ashlander with gold or goods in hand would be turned away. This policy protects and empowers the House. The greatest defense remains a wall built of gold, and many foes have broken against the profitable walls of House Hlaalu.\n"
"\n"
"The most honorable conclusion to any conflict is compromise. When two parties seeking balance come together in any exchange, compromise becomes the natural conclusion. Anything can be achieved if both the left hand and the right hand work together. Not everyone is reasonable, however. Sometimes others must be coaxed into compromise. For that, the House Hlaalu Guard stands ready."

"(An Excerpt)\n"
"\n"
"Any legitimate merchant who's traded in eastern Greenshade knows to avoid the old Merchant Tunnels.\n"
"\n"
"In old times, when we first asked the Green to create a passage, the tunnels were an important byway, a defense against the wilder things that live in the forest.\n"
"\n"
"Now, it's a haven for all that's illicit, illegal, and disgusting. Backhanded traders moving unreliable product at outrageous costs. Black market trade. Skooma. It's all there. A sure way to call one's legitimacy as a merchant into question is to pass through those tunnels.\n"
"\n"
"For this reason, though the way is treacherous, it is advised to avoid the tunnels and take the low route over the bridge, beyond the bone pits.\n"
"\n"
"Other good advice for Valenwood merchants is to travel well-armed, and to keep a watch at night. The Wood Elves of the area are known for their thieving, and some can be extremely unfriendly to strangers.\n"
"\n"
"In general, it's a good idea to stick close to Woodhearth and other major settlements, rather than trying to deal with the backwoods Green Pact Bosmer personally. Let Wood Elves deal with Wood Elves."

"\n"
"Amethysts! Since my youth, their purple translucence has entranced me. I have made a career of searching for them all across Hammerfell, and count many notable, even legendary finds to my credit. But nowhere have I found amethysts so abundant as in the central Alik'r Desert. \n"
"\n"
"Amethysts are found in geodes, those heavy, dull stony orbs that conceal so much crystalline glory, and these geodes are always found in proximity with the lava rock that melted and flowed when the world was young. It has been long and long since the mounts of Hammerfell flowed with lava, and many of the old, old tubes have been covered over by layers of later rock, or weathered away and scattered as sand and gravel. \n"
"\n"
"But in the Hollow Wastes, that sunken, salty pit in the center of the Alik'r, the layers over the ancient lava have been scoured away by the relentless winds, and the flowstone is exposed as nowhere else in Hammerfell. Here, at Dak'fron, at Kulati, and at Zareth M'Kai, can be found the finest amethysts in western Tamriel. And many years I spent there, with pick, shovel, and dowsing rod, until they said I could find geode clusters deep in the ground by sense of smell alone. \n"
"\n"
"Nowadays, alas, I am too old to quarter the desert, searching for my beloved amethyst nodules. But if you are even in Rihad, stop in Ezdwelen's Gem Shop and buy an intaglio-engraved amethyst necklace for your best beloved. With such as I sell, even a heart of stone will melt and flow."

"This is important, so pay attention. You already think you know how to build an Alik'r caravel, but the new king over in Sentinel has ordered the shipyards to build all vessels to consistent standards—he thinks that'll make them easier to supply, since all the pieces are standardized, and also that we'll build them faster once we're into a routine. Maybe he's right, I don't know—but I do know that he's the king, and we're spending his gold, so we're going to do it his way. \n"
"\n"
"There's no change to how we lay the keel: we still scarf together sections of lumber with the longest piece in the middle, with the ends using planks cut from angled trunks so the curve is built right into the wood. But here's the new thing: the keel, stem, and stern posts are all rabbeted to secure the strakes and keep them parallel. And the posts aren't self-timber, they're made of inner and outer pieces to reinforce the curve. \n"
"\n"
"We still install the central rib first, then the fore and afters, but now we're going to lay battens across the upper, middle, and lower sections to guide the installation of the remaining ribs. Got that? Then we lay on the strakes as usual, starting with the futtocks, and finish with the inner hull. \n"
"\n"
"Get that all done, and we'll talk about how we're going to approach the rigging and outfitting."

"Simple recipes my mother jotted down for me, on the occasion of my marriage. This supper serves four.\n"
"\n"
"Mudcrab Cakes\n"
"\n"
"These do not travel well, but one can use leftover mudcrab this way if fresh crab meat is unavailable. You may season these quite liberally, as some find the flavor of mudcrab too earthy for their taste.\n"
"\n"
"Steam mudcrabs enough to obtain a pound of their succulent flesh, taking care to sort out the cartilage and shell.\n"
"\n"
"Add to the meat a half-pound of equal parts of imperial, and barley flour. Add water until the mixture can be formed into a ball. Season liberally with salt and ground peppercorns.\n"
"\n"
"Form the mixture into small pies, pressing together firmly, yet with the gentle touch. Fry them on an oiled griddle until crisp on both sides.\n"
"\n"
"Grilled Battaglir\n"
"\n"
"This dish can be made in advance as it reheats well over low coals. You can also place it at the edge of the fire while making the mudcrab cakes. Just remember to turn it now and then to heat it through on all sides.\n"
"\n"
"Gather a quarter peck of battaglir weeds. After cleaning them of dirt and any small bugs, finely chop the battaglir. \n"
"\n"
"Place large skillet onto the fire, throw in gobbets of beef drippings and melt. Fry the battaglir until the color turns a dark green. Add salt, pepper and garlic to taste. \n"
"\n"
"Serve over day-old bread."

"As per our conversations, here is the signed contract completing our deal. You should have also received the bottles of \"elixir\" that will cause the effects we desire. Be careful, as I had to deal with various nefarious organizations within Daggerfall to procure the amounts needed.\n"
"\n"
"Apply the contents of a full bottle to your daily haul of fish, then leave the treated fish for the harpies to feast upon. We should begin to see the effects within a matter of days.\n"
"\n"
"As the harpies consume the tainted fish, they will become extremely aggressive. As the harpy threat rises, the nasty birds will have to be dealt with. Once they're eliminated, we can expand Daggerfall down the coast and increase our investment a hundredfold.\n"
"\n"
"Secrecy is imperative. In the meantime, I will hire another group to procure harpies and their eggs. We might as well make a profit from the creatures while we're at it. No one needs to know how this started. It should appear that we're just doing our civic duty and helping the great city of Daggerfall in its time of need.\n"
