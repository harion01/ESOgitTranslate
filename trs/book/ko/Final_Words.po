Here, I am treating the injuries suffered by Shornhelm Guard soldiers in the aftermath of an unwarranted attack by forces bearing the colors and tabards of House Montclair."

"\nAldred Berri: Stab wound to the right abdomen, applied a healing poultice and wrapped the wound tightly."

"\nFinia Derone: Took an arrow in her right arm, just above the elbow. Applied a healing poultice and wrapped the wound tightly. She should be ready for duty as needed."

"\nMarbenn Dugot: Sword slash across the stomach exposed his intestines and he lost much blood. I have done what I can, but I do not believe he will last the night."
"\n"
"\nLeobert Favret: A spear puntured his left lung. I have given him a tincture to relieve his pain, but there is little more I can do for him. I expect the end to come quickly."
"\n"
"\nRolbert Emain: I have not determined the exact nature of his wound, for it doesn't resemble any weapon I am familiar with. If I didn't know any better, I'd say he was gutted by the claws of a large animal. I have applied healing tinctures to the wound, and remarkably it appears to be closing. I'll need to watch Rolbert closely to see if there are any adverse effects."
"\n"
"\nPixot Gane: Another strange wound, this one along the left side of the neck and down the back. It appears to be a combination of bites and scratches, but the soldier claims he doesn't remember how the wounds were inflicted. He burns with fever, and nothing I have provided has yet to alleviate his discomfort."
"\n"
"\nVivie Donze: This soldier received a shallow cut across her right side and should be capable of returning to duty immediately. However, she claims that the wound burns and her stomach hurts. Is she faking these symptoms or did I miss something in my examination?"
"\n"
"\nI must also report that I was apparently hurt as well, though I don't remember how. I discovered a deep scratch along my left arm, as though something with long, sharp nails drew a line down my arm. The cut isn't that serious, which is why I haven't informed Lieutenant Fairfax as yet, but it does burn. And I find myself unusually hungry, although food doesn't appeal to me."

"\n"
"\n픽솟 게인(Pixot Gane): 이상한 상처. 목의 왼쪽을 따라 등 뒤까지 있다. 물린 상처와 긁힌 상처가 섞여 있는 것 같음. 하지만 병사는 그가 어떻게 상처를 입었는지 기억하지 못한다고 했음. 열이 심함. 그의 불편을 덜어주기 위해 줄 수 있는게 아무 것도 없음."

"\n비비에 돈즈(Vivie Donze): 이 병사는 오른쪽 몸을 가로질러 얕게 베인 상처를 입음. 그리고 즉시 임무를 수행하러 갈 수 있어야 함. 하지만 그녀는 상처가 화끈거리고 배가 아프다고 주장함. 그녀가 증상을 속이고 있는 건지 내가 진찰에서 놓친 게 있는지 모르겠음."
