"I am Dutheil, Artisan of Oblivion, and these are my Vaults of Madness. Look upon them and cower.\n"
"\n"
"They were designed to contain my enemies, villains who lived only to inflict misery upon me. The wretches tormented me for years, jeered, prodded, taunted, before finally turning the nobles of Wayrest against me. They ruined my career as the preeminent architect in the West.\n"
"\n"
"Such was my rage that I sought the Daedra, who came to me, offering a pact for my talents. They would capture my tormentors and imprison them here. In return, I would build for them. I accepted gladly. \n"
"\n"
"In Wayrest, I designed inescapable prisons for law enforcement, opaline palaces for the nobles of the Gardens District. My works were heralded as a crossing of artistic perfection and architectural function. But what I've built for the planes of Oblivion are so much more. Black spires for the Scheming Lord of Coldharbour are instruments of torture as much as they are monuments to his greatness. The razor pits of Deadlands never dull, and cut flesh, bone, and spirit essence for the Prince of Destruction—in ways that even the most powerful healers can never mend.\n"
"\n"
"Even so, all of these creations—from the gestating cyst-towers of Molag Bal to the sparkling Pellingare Manor in Wayrest—are but baubles compared to the Vaults. They are my Daedric Crescent, my Akaviri Warblade, the culmination of my skill, my greatest creation.\n"
"\n"
"And they grow only more extraordinary with time. What was once a place of eternal anguish for the three charlatans who ruined my mortal life has grown to become a nexus of torture for all manner of Tamrielic souls. So exquisite is the work I do in these Vaults that even the Daedric Princes send souls to me to oversee.\n"
"\n"
"And as for you, dear guest—know that the pain you experience here is the result of lifetimes of refinement and iteration. Embrace it, and writhe, and be awed."

"이곳은 나에게 고통을 가하기 위해서만 살았던 내 적들과 악인들을 수용하기 위해 설계되었다. 비열한 놈들은 수 년 동안 나를 야유하고, 괴롭히고, 비웃엇으며, 결국에는 웨이레스트의 귀족들이 나를 내치도록 만들었다. 놈들은 서부의 걸출한 건축가로서의 내 경력을 망쳐 버렸다.\n"
"\n"
"엄청난 분노에 휩싸여 나는 데이드라를 찾았으며, 데이드라는 나에게 찾아와 내 재능에 대한 계약을 제안했다. 데이드라가 내 고문자들을 잡아 이곳에 수감한다. 그 대가로 난 데이드라를 위한 건축물을 짓는다. 나는 기쁘게 받아들였다.\n"

"나는 웨이레스트에서 법의 집행을 위한 탈출 불가능의 감옥과 정원 구역의 귀족들을 위한 유백색의 궁전들을 설계했다. 내 작품들은 예술적인 완벽함과 건축학적인 기능의 조화로 명성을 떨쳤었다. 하지만 내가 오블리비언 차원에서 건축한 것들은 그것들을 훨씬 뛰어넘는다. 콜드하버의 교활한 군주를 위한 검은 첨탑은 그의 위대함을 보여주는 기념물일 뿐만 아니라 고문 도구이기도 하다. 파괴의 군주를 위해 지루할 틈 없이 살과 뼈, 그리고 영혼 정수를 잘라내는 데드랜드의 면도칼 구덩이에서 입은 상처는 가장 강력한 치유사가 온다 해도 회복시킬 수 없다.\n"
"\n"
"그렇기는 하지만, 몰라그 발의 낭포 탑에 대한 계획에서부터 웨이레스트의 반짝거리는 펠린게어 저택에 이르는 이 모든 창조물들은 지하실과 비교하면 싸구려에 지나지 않는다. 지하실은 나의 데이드릭 신월도요, 아카비리 전쟁검이자, 내 기술의 정점, 내 가장 위대한 창조물이다.\n"
"\n"
"그리고 지하실은 시간이 갈수록 그 대단함이 커져 갈 뿐이다. 내 필멸의 삶을 망쳐 놓았던 세 명의 돌팔이들을 위한 영원한 괴로움의 장소였던 이곳은 이제 모든 탐리엘에 존재하는 온갖 종류의 영혼들을 위한 고문의 결합체로 성장했다. 데이드릭 군주들마저도 내가 이 지하실에서 하는 작업의 정교함을 보고 고문할 영혼을 보내곤 한다.\n"
"\n"
"그리고 내 소중한 손님이여, 네가 여기서 경험하는 고통은 평생의 개선과 반복을 통한 결실이라는 것을 알아야 한다. 그것을 포옹하고 온 몸을 비틀며 경외하라."

"\n"
"Pardon the lengthy discussion of morality to follow. We shall reach the meat of this meal—the actual procedure of soul-trapping—soon enough. I was compelled to include an introductory chapter to this revised version of \"Soul-Trapping\" after the ethical arguments that sprang from the publication of the first edition.\n"
"\n"
"Soul-trapping is the art of taking a creature's soul upon death and confining it in an appropriately-sized phylactery. Throughout the history of magic, mages and philosophers alike have battled back and forth about the morality of the art.\n"
"\n"
"Some mages would argue that, once dead and soul-trapped, a creature's spirit is merely an echo of its previous life, no longer aware of what goes on around it. Even those rare individuals who become phantasmal hunters lurking the darkness of Tamriel are nothing more than predators acting on natural impulses. To these mages, once dead, an individual loses some spark, some intangible element in biological death, that cannot be regained. As such, they argue, soul-trapping is not unethical. In fact, it's a waste of resources to leave the soul of the deceased free.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, we the living, being still alive, can never know for certain. Theories regarding the afterlife are myriad, but even the most powerful mages in Tamriel have never returned from death's reach to report their level of awareness in that state. As such, there are those in the communities of Tamriel, both magical and not, that decry the use of soul-trapping spells. The eccentric Archmagus Elomion of the First Era famously asked, \"Would you like to spend your afterlife powering my levitation staff?\" The Archmagus claimed to never have used a soul-trapping spell in all his years.\n"
"\n"
"Adding some weight to that argument is the rumor that one such soul has retained a very mortal sentience in its entrapment. If rumors are true, the Altmeri royalty have utilized an advanced form of soul-trapping to imprison some ancient High Kinlord for the duration of his afterlife (perhaps one of the Rilises—that lot is notoriously manic, and their souls must be doubly so). The High Kinlord has reportedly maintained his (its?) faculties, taunting and jeering his keepers on a daily basis. I don't know where this Kinlord might be, and I don't want to know. I'd like to keep my head. But his very existence speaks to how aware a soul can be, and the morality of soul-trapping can be further postulated from there.\n"
"\n"
"What do I believe about the subject? I've written ten volumes on trapping souls: instructional, theoretical, and historical in nature, and I cannot answer that question. It is my belief that you won't be able to, either. But what you can answer is whether the material I teach in the following volumes is worth using. All I ask is that you read them."

"You have your orders, Alduril, and you'll execute them as well as you always do, but I wanted to apologize again for this assignment. It would never have been necessary had the Canonreeves not dissolved my plans for a garrison at Tempest Island. I had drawn requisitions to bring a fleet of Swan Ships—enough to repel any force of long-range vessels from Pyandonea—to defend the island. The request was denied.\n"
"\n"
"\"We can deal with the Maormer after the Pact and the Covenant,\" they said, citing a lack of resources to devote to my \"unfounded apprehension.\" So I reminded a few acquaintances of favors owed from conflicts long past and managed to send a few scout ships.\n"
"\n"
"They reported unusual weather phenomena the first week, swift lightning storms off the coast that came and went in moments. The second week, the storms intensified, and under cover of inclement weather came a fleet of warships, chitinous hulls with opalescent sails, decks illuminated with the sparks of lightning staves and swords—Maormer war materiel, just as we remember them. My scouts estimated their force is small, not a full-scale invasion fleet, but the coast of Malabal Tor will be entirely at their mercy when they decide to attack.\n"
"\n"
"Had the Canonreeves taken just a moment from their maps tracking the movements of Orcs and Men, they'd see that a dire threat was growing under their noses. Every week my scouts reported an increase in Maormer strength, a few ships every few days, appearing under the cover of some kind of weather magic. Months too late, the Canonreeves agree with me, now.\n"
"\n"
"I know we ask much from you and your soldiers, but if you don't stop them, Alduril, the Dominion will have yet another front to fight in this war. More than any Daedra, more than the Ebonheart Pact, more than the Daggerfall Covenant, the Maormer want the Altmer choked from existence. They always have.\n"

"\n"
"It is popular belief that all undead and phantasmal revenants are slaves to their necromantic biology. Indeed, like most predatory wildlife, many of these creatures exist only to absorb or consume the energy of the living. They should never be bargained or reasoned with. An Altmer should deal with such creatures in the way she would handle a rabid wolf, or malevolent Orc: with extreme prejudice.\n"
"\n"
"However, there are those among the post-living that possess or have achieved sentience, like vampires, liches, and wraiths. Dialogue is possible with creatures such as these, as long as one keeps certain discretions in mind:\n"
"\n"
"1.\tAn undead who speaks is bound to be powerful. Any creature whose magic is potent enough to allow it sentience in death deserves an Altmer's begrudging admiration.\n"
"\n"
"2.\tAn undead can never be trusted. Though we should respect the undead and their power, all undead want something from the living, and there is little to stop them from taking it. An Altmer must remain guarded in their presence. Always.\n"
"\n"
"3.\tAn undead might not be as she appears. Many powerful mages possess illusory spells to alter their appearance, and so, too, do the undead. The wandering spirit of a lost child could be a starving lich in disguise.\n"
"\n"
"That said, there is much an Altmer can learn from the accumulated knowledge of a sentient undead, if dialogue can be achieved. The discerning Altmer could learn of ancient spells from time immemorial, first-hand accounts of historical events, or the locations of lost relics—if said Altmer can pose salient questions. When conversing with the likes of the undead, an Altmer wants to maintain an appearance of:\n"
"\n"
"1.\tHumility. An Altmer's heritage should afford her much, and in an ideal world, all peoples, including liches, vampires, and wraiths, would adhere to the Altmeri concept of class and proceed accordingly. However, most undead, even Altmeri undead, rarely adhere to social conventions. As such, even the most well-bred of Altmer should refer to point 1 in the previous listing. Think of the undead as elders: powerful, unflinching, and prone to anger.\n"
"\n"
"2.\tIntelligence. As is true with the Altmer, especially well-bred Altmer, the undead do not suffer fools. Without being overtly obvious, an Altmer wants to seek openings to display magical acumen or cunning to show that she is not to be trifled with. Again, think of intimidating a stern elder into compliance.\n"
"\n"
"3.\tDiscipline. Assuming an Altmer can enter into peaceful communication with a lich, wraith, vampire, or otherwise, she will undoubtedly have many questions. But she should be wary of the number of questions she asks. An undead will impart its knowledge willingly or not at all.\n"
"\n"
"In Part II of this collection, I'll detail hurdles that may come up in conversation with the undead, specifically with wraiths, vampires, and liches, all of which require different operations of social intelligence."

"\n"
"This collection contains privileged information regarding the Daedric Prince Mehrunes Dagon. In case you've been living in an Ayleid ruin since the dawn of recorded history, involvement with Dagon and his ilk is frowned upon quite fiercely by most populations of Tamriel. Having this book or its companion volume in your possession could earn you suspicion from your neighbors as well as agents of the law. In many districts worship of the Master of Razors is illegal, and communion rituals involving the Daedric Prince are punishable by death.\n"
"\n"
"Amongst even the Daedric Princes, none are more openly concerned with the suffering of mortals. Whenever Dagon appears he leaves destruction in his wake, and contact with the Master of Razors often results in death for the conjurer—along with everyone in the vicinity. Sudden floods, thunderstorms, and other natural disasters all over Tamriel have been tied to communions with Mehrunes Dagon, and the most detailed account I've read about occurred in Eastmarch.\n"
"\n"
"Hranvard Frostfinger, a witch of Eastmarch, is said to have sacrificed thirteen innocents to Dagon in a single night, prompting the Daedric Prince to briefly open a portal from the Deadlands to Skyrim. The only witnesses were members of the Direfrost family, a clan of witch-hunters, who managed to find and slay Hranvard. Immediately following, they came under a mysterious and brutal attack themselves. Their leader, Yllothon, was the only survivor, who later wrote in his memoirs:\n"
"\n"
"\"We followed the stench of burning flesh for a half-mile, and we caught up to (Hranvard) at nightfall, by the Sea of Ghosts. She lay cackling among her thirteen victims, whose bodies had been stacked in a mass grave, encircled by spidery writing. Slaying her was an easy task—all it took was a single silver bolt. But when the deed was done, the air suddenly began to boil and crack. Fearing some residual spell, I had my men retreat up the nearest pass, where we watched the snow below catch fire, and the sky split apart with flame. We turned to flee, but it was too late. Fire poured from the wound in the air and engulfed my thirty men. I tried to help them but the flames wouldn't die, and wouldn't burn my flesh. A voice bellowed from the burning maw above, 'You will suffer better among the living.'\" \n"
"\n"
"Many, including members of the Mages Guild, are skeptical of Yllothon's story, respected as he was amongst the Direfrost hunters. They found no sign of Mehrunes Dagon at the Sea of Ghosts—save the blasted, mirrored sand. Obviously, the Direfrosts disagree: there was still the matter of thirty missing hunters. The Direfrosts have since intensified their war against the covens of Eastmarch.\n"
"\n"
"The Mages Guild, however, has struck the event from their records of note, citing the blasted sand at the Sea of Ghosts as a meteorological phenomenon. But I believed Yllothon was correct; I was there, as a senior advisor on the party that surveyed that beach.\n"
"\n"
"Volume II of this collection contains a detailed account of everything I found at the Sea of Ghosts, including half of the \"spidery circle\" that Yllothon describes. Any aspiring conjurer who wants a chance at contacting Mehrunes Dagon should follow me there."

"There are many legendary gladiators who've made their names in the Blessed Crucible. Among them, Felhorn, Sanarel the Great, and Aleris the Shroud are known for their formidable combat prowess and fighting spirit. But others, like Josef the Intolerant, have become famous for other reasons.\n"
"\n"
"Let me first say that the Blessed Crucible of Skyrim features an amazing array of competitors, with combatants arriving from all over Tamriel to test their mettle. In this time of warring alliances, it's not just anywhere that an Altmer would drag a wounded Orc to safety, or where a Redguard would so readily step into an arrow's path for an Argonian, but the Blessed Crucible is one such place. In the Crucible, one's team is one's nation, and the struggle for the Brimstone Crown the national religion.\n"
"\n"
"However, there was one man, a young gladiator named Josef. He came from the Breton Lion Guard, and was fresh-faced, decent with a blade. None questioned that he was a healthy boy, ready to take the Crucible by storm. But Josef could never understand the social phenomenon of the Crucible, and trusted only other Bretons. He could not fathom the fact that gladiators must place their trust in their teams, not in gladiators of the same race.\n"
"\n"
"Said gladiator Oberelle, \"Our match began, and this Breton boy sent his Khajiiti team member sprawling to the ground. Then he looked me in the eye and blinked twice, slowly. 'Is he trying to wink?' whispered my ally, Doumant. We capitalized on their folly and beat the boy and the Khajiit unconscious. One must never refuse such strokes of fortune in the Blessed Crucible.\"\n"
"\n"
"As time passed, young Josef grew increasingly frustrated. He scoffed at suggestions to collaborate with gladiators of other races. His demeanor incensed the Crucible audience along with its competitors, and management loved him for it. \"We would print Josef's face on currency if we could. He is a boon to us,\" they said.\n"
"\n"
"The gladiators felt differently.\n"
"\n"
"Said Dalu the Dunmeri Blade, \"Josef told me he would never collaborate with a kwama farmer. And he hounded me every day for kwama eggs. He was certain that I had some, or could, by some miracle, produce them. I have never even tasted a kwama egg. I was born in Skyrim.\"\n"
"\n"
"Said Ethenen, the Rabid Dunmer, \"Josef repeatedly referred to me as Dalu.\"\n"
"\n"
"Said Azrukana, the Crimson Cat, \"I told him he could trust me in battle. That he needed to, if he wanted to live for much longer as a gladiator. He rasped his voice and said, 'This one thinks you should have some moon sugar and keep your opinions to yourself.' I did not like that.\"\n"
"\n"
"Said Inarfar, the Skyforged Razor, \"When Hrasvard, my comrade of a decade, was slain in combat, I went to the Hall of Champions and I wept. That Breton boy found me and said, 'Did you run out of mead-coin? I know how that feels, but unlike you Nords, I wouldn't cry about it.' The beating that ensued in Hrasvard's honor lasted eight minutes.\"\n"
"\n"
"No gladiator had gained as much infamy as Josef in so short a time, but he soon disappeared.\n"
"\n"
"His current whereabouts are unknown."

"Witches and witch-hunters are, by nature, uncivil to one another, but the witches of Eastmarch and my clan, the Direfrost witch-hunters, have particularly bad blood between us. I cannot say I blame the witches for their hatred—we have clashed often in these mountainous regions, and we Direfrosts have become very good at slaying them. Eastmarch was once infested with the heathens, the landscape dotted with their covens. Everywhere one turned, one found sordid hovels built in honor of some Daedric Prince. Thanks to the efforts of my family over several generations, that number has dwindled to a scant few. They're there, to be sure—the schemes of Oblivion are myriad—but the witches move in fear, ducking between the narrowing shadows cast by the Flame of Direfrost.\n"
"\n"
"In the days of their abundance, they abducted innocents, murdered children, desecrated corpses. I will not mourn them when finally, and with great, glorious fanfare, we stamp them from the face of Eastmarch forever.\n"
"\n"
"I list below the most infamous leaders of those covens who have committed crimes such that Direfrosts of my generation can never forget them, lest we disrespect the desecrated dead. Daedric Pacts grant these witches long life, and I fear I may not live to see all of this lot rounded up and slain, but  when the last of them falls I implore posterity to raise a monument in remembrance of their victims, detailing their crimes and their death at Direfrost hands:\n"

Confirmed deceased.***\n"

"\n"
"The city of Wayrest owes much to its merchants for its ever-flourishing economy. The abundance of money has done the city wonders, earning Wayrest the moniker \"Jewel of the Bay\": the wealth of its citizens have paid for the shimmering stone used in the city's construction, the bright armor worn by the local law enforcement agents, and most significantly, the modern marvel of western Tamriel—the Wayrest Sewers.\n"
"\n"
"Written accounts dating back to the city's foundation hint that, until the Wayrest Sewers were finished, the city was a jewel mired in muck and mud. Vile, foul-smelling mud. Writes Silvia Cato, an Imperial sailor in 1E 801, \"The Bjoulsae River is a watercourse of refuse, of pungent tang, of disease, and the Iliac Bay is equally revolting where the Bjoulsae feeds into it. It's that damned Breton city.\"\n"
"\n"
"Today, the Bjoulsae River shines as brilliantly as Wayrest itself, thanks entirely to the sewers, which are a feat of engineering rivaling anything created by the Dwemer of old. The artisans ensured that the sewers' modular design permit travel across the city below ground as easily as above, as well as allow construction to continue to this day. The sewers, like the city itself, are regularly expanded. However, in its size lies the one drawback of the entire system: the sewers have become so large that Wayrest law enforcement has difficulty patrolling it all, and thus, crime finds its way even to the Jewel of the Bay. Like the city itself, most of these illicit activities can only be afforded by the rich, including skooma trade and necromancy (skooma is a narcotic that's widely banned across Tamriel, and necromancy, the magical art of raising the dead, is also forbidden in many regions).\n"
"\n"
"See Volume II for a list of noble families that donated most heavily to the sewer construction. The original designers who imagined the sewers just prior to the fall of Orsinium remain lost to time, though Volume III contains a list of artisans and engineers who have worked to expand development since the end of the First Era."

"—Are you in need of a flame spell? Conjure a Flame Atronach. You'll have command of a dozen such spells, in the form of a fiery avatar. \n"
"\n"
"—Are you caught in the dead of night and wishing you had prepared a light spell? Conjure a Will-o-the-Wisp: its natural luminescence banishes darkness. \n"

"—Do you lack a telekinesis spell to move a boulder out of your way? Conjure a Storm Atronach to lift it for you. \n"

"\n"
"—Is your life detection spell unable to discern a fleeing target from all the other living things in the wilderness? Conjure a Wolf Familiar to pick up the scent. \n"
"\n"
"The flexibility of Conjuration magic has been an unsung passion of mine, and I've compiled a comprehensive guide for replacing specific, commonly-used spells with Conjuration substitutions (see Volume II, page seven, for more).\n"
"\n"
"Conjuration even allows access to Daedric abilities (for those who dare to wield them). A mage well-versed in Conjuration can summon all variety of Daedra, from Scamps to Dremora Lords. Mine wouldn't be the first primer for spells like these, but Volume III of this collection contains detailed instructions on beckoning the denizens of Oblivion. \"The Origins of Conjuration\" is also a useful read on the subject.*\n"

"I realize I write highly of Conjuration here, almost extravagantly, but if you'll do me the favor of reading the rest of this collection (Volumes II-XXII), you'll find that my words have weight.\n"

"The Keeper's Primer Volume II: The Binding Stone\n"
"\n"
"From the Office of the Canonreeve of Corrections\n"
"\n"
"Altmeri texts reference many variations of the entrapment spell. Some of those spells, like the early First Era \"Aninaire's Tower,\" create physical fields around their targets. These varieties are unbreachable unless broken by an appropriate amount of force—like conjured stone walls, or shield wards turned inward. The effect differs in strength from spell to spell, but is generally effective for containing the layman prisoner, and certainly tougher to break free from than brick and mortar.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, sometimes a mage seeks to confine creatures that walls won't hold, magical or otherwise. Gaseous forms of the Wild Hunt, Nether Liches, and various ghosts and phantoms all have means to escape physical barriers. These must be imprisoned using spells that create completely impermeable surfaces while absorbing or stemming the magicka of their captives. These spells must be re-incanted constantly to avoid consuming themselves, usually at a high cost of magicka for the caster.\n"
"\n"
"The Binding Stone, which your Head Keeper will soon introduce to you if he hasn't already, functions as a combination of these spells. It's tangible, small, and therefore portable, but capable of holding all manner of magicka-wielding creatures—even ones as powerful as your charge.\n"
"I'm sure you understand the grave nature of what the prisoner's escape would mean, both to you, personally, and to Auridon and Tamriel as a whole. The condition of the Binding Stone is more important than the condition of your prisoner. Indeed, your very lives depend on the upkeep and maintenance of the Stone.\n"
"\n"
"And as for your prisoner: do not look at him. Do not speak to him. There is no specific danger in doing so, but any such interaction is a fruitless venture. Watch yourself, watch each other, do your duty, and your name will live forever among those who have committed everything to shield Auridon from his menace."

"An Introduction\n"
"\n"
"By Belami Llevarso\n"
"\n"
"Kwama eggs have always been a Dunmeri delicacy, though I've heard they've found their way into Imperial kitchens, too. (Who knows what grisly dishes that lot would make with Kwama eggs? Would they stuff chickens with them? Poach them and put them in a bap? They are a disdainful people, and they make disdainful food.)\n"
"\n"
"To cook a kwama egg with any measure of success is to master the sharp, sour flavor, and the gummy texture. Kwama eggs are similar to scrib jelly in this way, and many a young chef (even Dunmeri chefs whose elders should have better taught them) has attempted to mask the eggs behind other ingredients, to camouflage the perceived unpleasantness. This is an abominable practice. A chef should never apologize for a kwama egg in her dishes by sweetening or embittering them. If the dish is properly prepared, supporting the kwama eggs' natural qualities, a cultured diner will embrace the meal in all its pungent glory. \n"
"\n"
"But what does that preparation entail? Only a Dunmer could tell you. Because only the Dunmer have the lifetimes of experience necessary to call ourselves culinary masters of the kwama egg. It was we who first tamed the kwama, after all.\n"
"\n"
"I, in turn, have spent a large portion of my years (of which there are many) immersing myself in the art. I have served kwama eggs to peasants and paupers, grandmasters and grandmistresses, and delighted them all.  And you, dear reader, will find within these volumes the combined knowledge of my entire career. It takes a lifetime of cooking kwama eggs to truly understand the subtle, but brilliant differences between the various methods of preparation, and I have catalogued them all here—all the ones of worth, at least. Follow these recipes exactly. Just as a mage should hesitate to improvise in her spell-casting, lest she find a Daedra in her drawing room, the kwama egg chef should not stray from the paths I've laid out here—painstakingly crafted from years of trial and error.\n"
"\n"
"Believe me—if it works, I've found it. \n"
"\n"
"And put that moon sugar away. You'll insult the eggs."

"Civility and Etiquette Volume III: Wood Orcs, Part I\n"
"\n"
"Elden Hollow\n"
"\n"
"By Coristir, Sage Sojourner\n"
"\n"
"It is said that the Orcs came to be when the Aldmeri god, Trinimac, was devoured by the Daedric Prince Boethiah. As the myth goes, Boethiah excreted Trinimac's remains, and those Aldmer who followed Trinimac rubbed that excrement on themselves to become Orcs. Perhaps it's just a myth, but the imagery is appropriate: repugnant, ridiculous, and a little comical, like the Orcs themselves. It's said that, after a time, a sect of these people traveled into Valenwood and developed a tangential culture: the Wood Orcs. (For dealings with Orsinium Orcs, see Volume II.)\n"
"\n"
"The Orcs in general are difficult for Mer to interact with, but these Wood Orcs are similar in physicality to our Wood Elf cousins, the Bosmer. The Wood Orcs are blunter and more ill-tempered than the Bosmer, but should be handled in much the same way: with patience, guidance, and a careful eye. Without a proper Altmeri hand to lead them, both races have the potential to devolve into self-destructive, orderless savages that are an inconvenience and danger to all civilized people around them. \n"
"\n"
"So how should an Altmer deal with a Wood Orc?\n"
"\n"
"First, earn her respect. Like her northern, Orsinium cousins (the more common Orc variety), a Wood Orc admires physical strength, but she also prizes agility, speed, and geographical knowledge (equating that with tactical knowledge). Display some semblance of competence in these areas and you will earn her begrudging appreciation.\n"
"\n"
"Here are a few ways to begin a conversation (as a sign of respect, make sure to introduce yourself or at least establish eye contact first):\n"
"\n"
"1.\tOffer to begin an unarmed altercation and force the Wood Orc to submit. They enjoy fisticuffs.\n"
"\n"
"2.\tIf you find yourself walking with a Wood Orc, gain the lead and maintain it. This may lead to a footrace. Win it, and win the Wood Orc's approval.\n"
"\n"
"3.\tFind a large rock—equal to or greater than body size—and hurl it, within view. Use a strength spell if you must, but don't let the Wood Orc know.\n"
"\n"
"If you think this sounds like impressing your way into a tribe of athletic children, you would not be far wrong. Use the above methods with caution—predictable as they may be, Wood Orcs are individuals, and require improvisation in dealing with them.\n"
"\n"
"And here are a few things an Altmer should not do when interacting with Wood Orcs:\n"
"\n"
"1.\tFlaunt magical abilities. Though the Altmer know that displaying advanced magic shows a lifetime of dedication and mastery of the highest craft, all Orcs bear a cultural distrust of magic. In their ignorance, they believe magic's primary function is oppression of their people, and often bridle at its use.\n"
"\n"
"2.\tUnless you're intending to ignite a battle, never hide in the trees of Wood Orc territory. Walk in the open. As our Bosmer cousins have learned, the Wood Orcs do not take kindly to those who stalk their forests. They equate secret movement with malevolence and cowardice.\n"
"\n"
"In Part II of this collection, I'll detail specific hurdles that may come up in conversation with a Wood Orc, such as religion and Malacath, and the Wood Orc equivalent of Orsinium strongholds."

"품위와 예절 제 3권: 우드 오크들 제 1부\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"코리스티어, 현자 소쥬르네 지음\n"
"\n"
"오크들은 알드머의 신, 트리니막이, 데이드릭 군주 보에시아에게 삼켜졌을때 나타났다고 전해진다. 전설에 의하면, 보에시아가 트리니막의 잔해를 배설했고, 트리니막을 따르던 알드머들이 그 배설물들을 스스로에게 바르고 오크가 되었다고 한다. 아마도 단순한 신화에 불과하겠지만,  이것이 주는 이미지는 정확하다: 마치 오크들 스스로처럼  비위에 거슬리고, 황당하고, 약간은 우습다.  시간이 흐르고,  이들중 한 분파가 발렌우드로 이주하였고,  우드 오크라는 고유의 문화를 형성하였다고 전해진다. (오시니엄의 오크들에 대해서는, 2권을 볼 것.)\n"
"\n"
"대체로 오크들은 머들에게 대하기 힘들지만, 우드 오크들은 물질적으로 우리 우드 엘프 사촌들, 보스머와 비슷하다. 우드 오크들은 보스머들보다 더 질나쁘고 퉁명스럽지만, 보스머와 비슷한 방법으로 대응해야 한다. : 끈기와, 인도와, 조심스러운 눈길로.  적절한 알트머의 손길로 이끌어주지 않는다면, 두 종족 모두다 문명화된 시민들에게 불편과 위험을 안겨주는 자기 파괴적인 , 무질서한 야만인으로 전락할 가능성이 있다.\n"
"\n"
"그렇다면 어떻게 알트머가 우드 오크를 처리해야 하는가?\n"
"\n"
"우선, 그들의 존경을 얻어라. 그들의 북쪽에 있는 오시니엄 형제들처럼(좀더 흔한 오크의 유형이다), 우드 오크들은 물리적 힘을 동경한다,하지만 그들은 민첩성,속도, 그리고 (전술적 지식과 같은 수준의)지정학적  지식 또한 치하한다. 해당 분야에서 경쟁의 유사성을 보여준다면, 당신은 그들의  기껍지 못한 칭찬을 받을 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"여기 몇가지 대화를 시작하는 방법이 있다.(존중의 표시로써, 자기소개를 하거나, 최소한 먼저 눈을 마주치도록 하자)\n"
"\n"
"1. 그들에게 가벼운 싸움을 제안하고 우드 오크를 쓰러트려라. 그들은 주먹다짐을 좋아한다.\n"
"\n"
"2. 만일 당신이 우드 오크와 걷고있다면, 선두에 서서 이를 유지하라. 이는 자주 도보 경주로 이어진다. 승리하고, 우드 오크의 인정을 받아라\n"
"\n"
"3. 커다란- 몸의 크기와 같거나 더 거대한- 바위를 찾아서 시야 내에서  집어던져라. 필요하다면 근력강화 마법을 써도 좋다, 하지만 우드 오크들이 알아채지 못하게 하라.\n"
"\n"
"만약에 당신에게 이것이 몸만 건장한 어린이들에게 당신의 인상을 주는것이라고 생각한다면, 그 말은 꽤 틀리지 않았다. 위의 방법들을  조심스럽게 사용하라 - 그들이 비록 예상하기 쉬울지언정, 우드 오크들은 개인이기 때문에,그들을 상대할때에  상황에 따른 융통성이 필요하다.\n"
"\n"
"그리고 여기, 알트머들이 우드 오크들과 교류할때 하지 말아야 하는 행동들이 있다.\n"
"\n"
"1. 마법적 능력 뽐내기. 비록 진보된 마법을 발휘하는 것이 일생에 걸친 헌신과 고급 기술들의 연마를 보여주는 것이라는것을 알트머들은 알지만, 모든 오크들은 문화적으로 마법에 불신을 가지고있다. 그들의 무지 속에서, 그들은 마법의 첫번째 기능이 그들의 사람들을 속박하고, 사용함에 따라 자주 굴레에 씌우는것이라고 믿는다.\n"
"\n"
"2. 전투를 벌일 생각이 없다면,  우드 오크 영토 내부의 나무에 숨지 말아라. 우리 보스머 친척들이 배웠듯이 공개된 곳으로 다녀라, 우드 오크들은 그들의 숲을 거니는 자들을 좋게 보지 않는다. 그들은 은밀한 움직임을 악의와 비겁함과 동등하게 본다.\n"
"\n"
"이 책의 2부에서는,  종교나, 말라카스, 그리고 우드 오크들의  오시니엄 성채의 대채제 같은, 우드 오크와의 대화에서 생길 수 있는 특정 걸림돌에 대하여 다루도록 하겠다. "

"Bring this to Neidir's attention immediately. It's a transcript of an old text, but she needs to see this. Beg her pardon for the conjecture on Nord legends and Psijic nonsense, but this text contains the angle of attack she was looking for:\n"
"\n"
"Weather magic has never been an exact science, perhaps because of the temperamental nature of what it seeks to control.\n"
"\n"
"Minor spells to conjure gusts of wind or forks of lightning are common, but manipulation of a region's climate is much more difficult to achieve. Our war wizards have longed for the ability to lower catastrophic hailstorms onto enemy borders as a preamble to invasion, or to halt a blizzard to make an unexpected march through inclement weather.\n"
"\n"
"There are claims to such spells—spells originating from foreign lands and beyond.\n"
"\n"
"Legend has it that a sect of Nords in faraway Skyrim command the spell-like language of dragons, which allowed them some mastery over the weather. Accounts of these Nords' abilities during the Merethic Era Dragon War include the power to diminish fogs, mists, and clouds with the sheer bravado of their shouts. Negil's \"Dragons at Windhelm\" notes that an army of these bellowing Nords foiled an airborne sneak attack by dragons who sought to strike under a cover of storm clouds. Negil writes, \"We thought the heavy clouds looked better parted, and when we spoke our Words of Power, the clouds thought so, too. But even with their passing, the sun remained hidden. A then-apparent wing of dragons stretched across the blue, and the curse that escaped Vofodor's mouth brought a hearty guffaw to mine. Our Words of Power did not spare us the battle, but they told us battle was coming. We joined it gladly.\" The Maormer lack access to the dragon language, but I have confidence anything the Nords can accomplish we can "
"match.\n"
"\n"
"Far to the southwest of Skyrim, members of the Psijic Order have been long-rumored to possess spells cast in the Old Way of magic that can bend the elements to the user's desire. Our scouts have reported sudden lightning and flash rain turning to small-scale blizzards off the coast of Artaeum for years. It's possible instructional texts on the matter exist—and translating them from the Old Way into intelligible magic will be difficult, but it would be an excellent starting point.\n"
"\n"
"Arresea's \"The Daedric Primer\" describes a spell devised by Sheogorath, Daedric Prince, called Manipulate Weather. She writes, \"Sheogorath's spell folio includes an incantation to match the weather with his mood. The Lord of the Madhouse has been known to teach the spell to mortals in his favor, allowing them to alter the climate of an entire region. Unfortunately, the spell functions at Sheogorath's whim, no matter who casts it—meaning it functions entirely randomly. There are stories of his followers trying to stymie flashfloods but summoning torrential rain instead, or trying to put out brush fires and feeding the flames with unwanted lightning storms, to Sheogorath's delight. Making a Daedric Pact with Sheogorath is probably not in our best interest, but it seems there is something we can learn from the Prince of Madness.\n"
"\n"
"I include the above examples to say that large-scale weather control has been noted across the world, to convince King Orgnum or any in his close circle that weaponizing such an ability would be an incredible asset to the Maormer military. \n"
"\n"
"I set out to prove as much this past winter, with the help of twenty journeyman mages. We didn't quite succeed—though we're on the cusp of success. We started by clearing an open plain near the sea and created a lightning storm by manipulating the charge of a passing cloud with our own skeins of lightning. It worked, but we lost a member of our group (entirely regrettable) to the sudden storm and a fork of wayward lightning. It's possible we would all have perished had our storm not consumed itself. We tried several times, managing to lengthen the duration of the storm each time, even learned to direct it out over the water. But the duration of our spell remained our enemy, and we eventually had to admit that the exercise would be futile in a battle. \n"
"\n"
"We concluded that if we had had some way to physically suspend our spell at a high altitude—perhaps with a conduit device? Perhaps a series of devices—we would eliminate the need for continued expenditure of magicka and free the casters to direct a storm across a great distance."

"아레세아의 \"데이드라 입문서\"에는 데이드릭 프린스인 쉐오고라스가 창안한 날씨 조작이라 불리는 주문이 기록되어 있다. 그녀는 이렇게 서술하고 있다. \"쉐오고라스의 주문서에는 날씨를 자신의 기분과 일치시키는 주문이 적혀 있다. 매드하우스의 왕은 자신이 마음에 들어한 필멸자들에게 주문을 가르쳐 주고, 그 지역 일대의 날씨를 바꿀 수 있게 했다고 전해진다. 불행하게도, 이 주문은 누가 시전하든 아무 상관 없이 오직 쉐오고라스의 기분에 따라 작용한다. 즉, 완전히 무작위라는 의미이다. 그의 신봉자가 홍수를 막으려 했지만 대신 폭우가 쏟아지거나, 산불을 막으려 했지만 대신 원치 않게 번개폭풍이 쳐서 불이 더 번지거나 했다는 이야기가 전해진다. 쉐오고라스와 데이드라의 조약을 맺는 것은 우리가 관심을 가져야 할 대상은 아니지만, 이것으로 보아 광기의 프린스에게도 배워야 할 점이 있는 듯하다.\n"
"\n"
"이상의 예시를 들어 이와 같이 말할 수 있다. 대규모의 날씨 조작은 세계 전역에 기록되어 있고, 오그넘 왕이나 그의 측근들이 이러한 능력을 무기로 사용한다면 마오머 군의 엄청난 자산이 될 것이다.\n"

"Rajhin, he who is fleet of foot, the very embodiment of speed, agility, and slyness, has borrowed many treasures from coffers across the lands. No possession is safe from his desire—not even those of the Daedric Princes.\n"
"\n"
"Rajhin's most well-known plunder was the celebrated Ring of Khajiit, named after our people. It was once the Anticipation's Finger, and only found its way to Tamriel because it was stolen from the eighth arm of the Webspinner herself. With the Ring of Khajiit, Rajhin grasped the spark of godhood. It wrapped him in shadow so dark that none could reach him. Not the Anticipation of Vivec; not even the passage of time.\n"
"\n"
"But Rajhin wasn't finished. On his way out, he spied the killing word of the Spider, the black edge of shadow, and claimed it, as well. So swift were these takings that the Anticipation of Vivec was unaware anything went missing. Dark and sharp was the anger that followed, but Rajhin was no longer there. Rajhin is not cruel, or malicious—sometimes, when the Moons fit his mood, he gives them back.\n"
"\n"
"From the Webspinner's threads, Rajhin found his way to a land where all trees have fallen, and the only currency is knowledge. There, Rajhin pillaged the Book that Knows from the one who knows it all and disappeared amongst sheaves in the wind. The lord of that land has never stopped seeking his treasured volume, and, sometimes, when the Moons are right—he finds it. Because, sometimes, Rajhin gives it back.\n"
"\n"
"They say that, eventually, Rajhin took too much, too often, that the Ring of Khajiit tired of his capers. They say that the Ring abandoned Rajhin as he was surrounded by enemies, that it was his undoing. This one knows that Rajhin simply gave the Ring back."

"\n"
"라진의 가장 유명한 약탈품은 우리 종족의 이름을 따서 명명된 카짓의 반지이다. 그것은 한때 수호자의 손가락이라는 이름으로 탐리엘에 이르렀다. 과거에 웹스피너의 여덟 번째 팔에서 도난당했기 때문이다. 카짓의 반지를 착용한 라진은 신성한 기운을 얻게 되었다. 라진은 어두운 그림자에 휩싸였고 아무도 그를 찾아내지 못했다. 비벡의 수호자나 시간의 흐름조차도.\n"

"하지만 라진은 그걸로 만족하지 않았다. 그는 나가면서 그림자의 검은 칼날로 된 거미를 죽이는 말을 보고 그것도 손에 넣었다. 너무나 빨라서 비벡의 수호자는 무슨 일이 일어났는지도 눈치채지 못했다. 어둠과 뚜렷한 분노가 뒤따랐으나 라진은 이미 사라져 있었다. 라진은 잔혹하지도, 악의적이지도 않았다. 가끔씩 달이 분위기에 맞을 때면 훔친 물건을 돌려주는 일도 있었다.\n"
"\n"
"웹스피너의 실을 통해 라진은 모든 나무가 쓰러진 땅으로 가는 길을 찾아내었다. 유일한 화폐는 지식이었다. 그 곳에서 라진은 모든 것을 아는 자에게서 지식의 책을 훔쳐내 바람을 타고 사라졌다. 그 땅의 왕은 자신의 귀중한 책을 찾는 것을 멈추지 않았다. 가끔씩 적절한 달이 뜨는 날에는 찾아보기도 하였다. 라진이 돌려줄지도 모른다는 생각 때문이다.\n"
"\n"
"누군가에 의하면 결국에는 카짓의 반지가 그의 무수한 도둑질에 질려 그를 저버렸다고 한다. 라진이 적들에게 둘러싸였을 때, 반지는 그를 내버려두었고, 그는 결국 파멸했다고 전해진다. 카짓은 알고 있다. 라진은 그저 반지를 되돌려준 것 뿐이라는 것을."

"\n"
"Volendrung is one of the most notorious mythological artifacts in history. It has cultural ties to the Dwemer as well as the Daedra, though scholars fail to agree on just about every detail that has ever been written about it—including whether or not different accounts are referencing the same object.\n"
"\n"
"Academics recognize one such artifact, called Volendrung, as a Dwemer relic forged by Clan Rourken. It was carried into battle as a family symbol as much as it was the chieftain's weapon, and was made famous when the Rourkens refused to join the First Council of Chimer and Dwemer. The other Dwemer forsook them for the slight, and the Rourkens refused to stay with their people if it meant an alliance with the Chimer—their sworn enemies.\n"
"\n"
"So the Rourken chieftain hurled Volendrung into the sky, declaring that their people would find a home wherever it landed. Volendrung thus served as a guiding light for Clan Rourken in exile as the Hammer roared, beastlike, across the sky. It shone like a second sun during the day, mirrored the moons at night, and led the Rourken to the other side of the continent. There, they supposedly founded the fabled city of Volenfell—which has yet to be discovered in the modern era, if it ever truly existed.\n"
"\n"
"But how did the unidentified Rourken chieftain manage such a tremendous throw? Dwemer armies were known for their engines of war, and their mechanical infantry. If the Dwemer had the capability to project a weapon cross-continent by hand, why did they never utilize such long-range assaults in warfare? Even a modern Arch-Mage would have difficulty concocting a spell to launch an object over such a distance. Unless Volendrung was actually a flying engine, powered by lost Dwemer mechanics, the whole story reeks of a Bosmer tale.\n"
"\n"
"Some skeptics, including this one, believe the Dwemer Volendrung's flight is simply poetic imagery representing the wandering exile of Clan Rourken.\n"
"\n"
"A second hammer called Volendrung, this time a Daedric artifact belonging to the Daedric Prince Malacath, exists in records nearly as old as the Dwemer version. Malacath's relic echoes the Dwemer name, and for this reason, many assume that it is the same legendary weapon. But why would the God of Curses associate himself with an object forged by enemies? To make a mockery of Dwemer work? To take something the Dwemer treasured and use it as an instrument against them? A rather subversive and indirect action—unbecoming of Malacath's historically straightforward mentality.\n"
"\n"
"Angarin's \"The Daedric Armory\" speculates on the Hammer's magical features: the text cites several Mages Guild papers, claiming the Hammer empowers its wielder, and drains the strength of struck foes—very much in line with a Malacathan design. There is little doubt that the relic described could be tied to the God of Curses. What is in doubt is whether it was named by mortals or by Malacath himself—and whether the Rourken Clan wielded the same Hammer in centuries past.\n"

"볼렌드렁은 역사상 가장 악명 높은 신화 시대의 유물 중 하나이다. 그동안 볼렌드렁에 대해 학자들이 기록한 어떤 자세한 견해도 서로 일치하지 않고, 심지어 서로 같은 것에 대해 기록한 게 맞는지조차 의심스럽지만, 드웨머와 데이드라 간의 문화적 유대가 있었다는 것만은 확실하다.\n"
"\n"
"학자들은 볼렌드렁이라 불리는 가공물을 로어켄 부족이 만든 드웨머 유물로 인정하고 있다. 이것은 가문의 상징이자 족장의 무기로써 전투에 투입되었고, 로어켄 부족이 치머와 드웨머 간의 첫 의회에 가입하는 것을 거부한 것을 계기로 유명해졌다. 다른 드웨머는 그들을 사소하게 여겼고, 로어켄은 철천지 원수인 치머와 동맹을 맺는다면 그들을 떠나기로 결심했다.\n"
"\n"
"그리하여 로어켄 족장은 볼렌드렁을 하늘로 던지며 그것이 떨어진 곳을 고향으로 삼겠다고 다짐했다. 이렇게 하여 볼렌드렁은 추방된 로어켄 부족을 인도하는 빛으로써의 역할을 맡게 되었다. 던져진 망치는 짐승 같은 포효를 내며 하늘을 가로질렀다. 낮에는 두 번째 태양처럼 빛나고, 밤에는 달빛을 비추며 로어켄 부족을 대륙 반대편으로 이끌었다. 그렇게 하여 그들은 전설의 도시 볼렌펠을 발견했다고 한다. 그 도시는 실존한다고 하더라도 현재로써는 발견되지 않았다.\n"
"\n"
"하지만 정체불명의 로어켄 족장은 어떻게 그렇게 강하게 볼렌드렁을 던질 수 있었을까? 드웨머 군은 전쟁 수행 능력과 기계 보병대로 유명하다. 드웨머가 무기를 한 손으로 대륙을 넘을 정도로 던질 수 있는 능력이 있었다면, 왜 그 능력을 활용해서 장거리 전투를 벌이지 않은 걸까? 현대의 대마법사라고 해도 물체를 그렇게 멀리까지 날아가게 하는 마법을 만드는 것은 쉽지 않다. 볼렌드렁이 사실 사장된 드웨머의 비행 장치를 이용해서 날아가게 한 것이 아니라면 이 전말은 보스머의 이야기처럼 느껴진다.\n"
"\n"
"몇몇 회의론자는 이 가설조차 부정하며, 단순히 로어켄 부족이 여기저기 방황한 것을 시적 상상력으로 표현한 것이라고 주장하기도 한다.\n"
"\n"
"볼렌드렁이라 불리는 두 번째 망치는 데이드릭 프린스인 말라카스의 데이드릭 아티팩트로, 기록에 따르면 드웨머가 가진 것과 비슷하게 오래 전부터 존재해 왔다고 한다. 말라카스의 유물은 드웨머의 망치와 같은 이름이기 때문에 많은 사람들이 동일한 전설의 무기라고 생각한다. 하지만 왜 저주의 신이 자신의 적과 연관된 물건을 만들었을까? 드웨머의 작품의 모조품을 만드려고? 드웨머의 보물을 빼앗아서 그들에 대항하는 도구로 쓰려고? 오히려 파괴적이고 간접적인 마라카스의 역사적으로 단순한 사고 방식에 어울리지 않는 행동이다.\n"
"\n"
"안가린의 \"데이드라의 무기\"에서는 이 망치의 마법적 성질에 대해서 추측하고 있다. 여기서는 몇몇 마법사 길드의 논문을 인용한 후, 이 망치를 휘두른 자에게 힘을 줘서 공격받은 자의 힘을 빼앗아 간다고 주장하고 있다. 말라카스의 의도와 잘 어울리는 성질이다. 아직 작은 의문이 남아 있다. 유물을 명명한 것이 필멸자인지 말라카스 자신인지, 또한 로어켄 부족이 수 세기 후에도 동일한 망치를 사용했는지 여부이다.\n"

"The following is an intercepted Morag Tong memorandum in full, noted here for conjecture on the Daedric artifact Ebony Blade:\n"
"\n"
"Before I begin, let me preface by stating: the Daedric Prince Mephala and her worshippers value arcanum above all else—you will learn this, in time. To Hermaeus Mora, knowledge is power, but Mephala concerns herself with only the choicest morsels: knowledge secluded, undisclosed.\n"
"\n"
"The various Daedric artifacts associated with Mephala share this disposition, chief among them, the Ebony Blade, of which little is known. The records of the Tong themselves disagree on the properties locked within the Blade's metal. But I'll share what I know about it, and in return, you will complete your first assignment for the guild. I hope you'll find the Flowers of Gold a suitable base of operations. Your room is a favorite of mine. Warm and dry.\n"
"\n"
"First: the Blade initially passed into the Morag Tong's notice (this decade, at least) when our brother Orndras obtained it, taking it from Rivis, another brother. Rivis had the Blade kept in a safehouse for years, hidden from his fellow Morag Tong. How did Orndras find Rivis out? He'll take that secret to his grave, but his handlers whispered that the Web Spinner herself had told him. Even the Tong is unsure how the Blade is connected to Mephala, whether it is an extension of her physical form, or if her essence is bound to it, but it's important to her. And that makes it important to us.\n"
"\n"
"Second: Rivis was an ambitious mage, one of the Tong's most powerful. And he was not about to allow Orndras to leave his safehouse with the Ebony Blade in tow. There was a duel between them, and when Orndras drew first blood with the Blade—and failed to kill—he was surprised Rivis did not engulf him in a fiery spell. It's possible the Blade can silence a mage, stymie the flow of magicka, or simply absorb it.\n"
"\n"
"Third: Rivis was keen with an edge, and better skilled than Orndras. But Orndras wielded the Ebony Blade, and the wounds he suffered stitched themselves together as the battle continued—as Orndras dealt his less-precise cuts. Perhaps a restorative property of the Blade.\n"
"\n"
"Fourth: Rivis' last words were, \"The Vampire will be the end of us all.\" Orndras believed he was referring to the Blade, that Rivis had hidden it out of legitimate fear. I believe that even the most venerable of the Morag Tong will say anything when backed into a corner. I have.\n"
"\n"
"Fifth: Orndras retrieved the Blade, made a detailed report to his handlers—and then attempted to slaughter them. He murdered all but one. His actions had no discernible rhyme or reason or motive, and he was last seen on the third floor of the Flowers of Gold.\n"
"\n"
"Return the Ebony Blade to us, whether Orndras comes with it or not. Look for a Dunmer with a scar under his left eye."

"다음은 중간에 빼돌린 모락 통에 대한 견해서로, 데이드릭 아티팩트인 에보니 블레이드에 대한 추측을 기록하고 있다.\n"
"\n"
"시작하기 전에 다음과 같이 서문을 쓰겠다. 데이드릭 프린스 메팔라와 그 숭배자는 신비에 가치를 두고 있다. 이 일은 시간이 지나면 알게 될 것이다. 헤르메우스 모라에게 있어 지식은 힘이지만 메팔라는 남들에게 거의 알려지지 않은 은밀한 지식만을 추구한다.\n"
"\n"
"메팔라와 관련된 데이드릭 아티팩트에도 이러한 경향이 있다. 그 중 가장 유명한 것은 바로 거의 알려지지 않은 에보니 블레이드다. 금속 안에 깃든 성질에 대해서는 모락 통에 대한 기록 내에서조차 의견이 엇갈리고 있다. 하지만 내가 아는 것을 공유하고자 한다. 그 대신 길드의 첫 번째 임무를 완수하기를 바란다. 황금꽃에 걸맞는 작전 기지를 찾아 주기를 바란다. 네 방은 정말 마음에 든다. 따뜻하고 건조하다.\n"
"\n"
"첫 번째: 처음에는 모락 통이 (적어도 10년간은) 그 검에 주목했다. 우리 동료 오른드라스가 다른 동료 리비스한테서 그 검을 빼앗았을 때였다. 리비스는 모락 통의 다른 동료에게 비밀로 하고 검을 몇 년간 은신처에 보관하고 있었다. 오른드라스는 어떻게 그 검을 찾아냈는가? 그는 그 비밀을 무덤까지 가지고 가겠지만 그의 참모에 따르면 웹 스피너 본인이 그에게 고백했다고 한다. 모락 통조차도 그 검이 어떻게 메팔라와 관련되어 있는지 알 수 없다. 그녀의 신체적 형태의 연장인지, 그녀의 본질이 거기 묶여 있는 건지 확신할 수 없다. 하지만 그것이 그녀에게 중요하다는 것은 우리에게도 중요하다는 뜻이다.\n"
"\n"
"두 번째: 리비스는 야심에 가득 찬 인간으로, 모락 통의 가장 강력한 마법사였다. 그는 오른드라스가 은신처에서 검을 가져가는 것을 허락하지 않았다. 둘 사이에는 결투가 벌어졌고, 오른드라스가 검으로 리비스에게 상처를 내었을 때, 그는 리비스가 화염 주문으로 자신을 에워싸지 않는 것에 놀랐다. 그 검은 마법사를 침묵시키거나, 매지카의 흐름을 막거나 흡수하는 능력이 있었다.\n"
"\n"
"세 번째: 리비스는 여러 위험을 해쳐나간 전적이 있었고,  오른드라스보다 강력한 기술을 가지고 있었다. 하지만 오른드라스가 에보니 블레이드를 휘두르며 싸움을 계속하는 동안 그가 입은 상처는 저절로 치료되었다. 마치 상처를 입은 적이 없는 듯하였다. 분명 블레이드의 회복시키는 성질 때문일 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"네 번째: 리비스의 마지막 말은 \"우리 모두 결국에는 뱀파이어가 될 운명이다\"였다. 오른드라스는 그게 블레이드와 관련된 말이라고 믿었고, 리비스가 공포에 질려 검을 숨긴 것은 옳은 일이었다고 생각했다. 모락 통의 가장 충실한 일원조차도 궁지에 몰리면 모든 걸 불어 버릴 거라고 생각한다. 적어도 내 생각엔 그러하다.\n"
"\n"
"다섯 번째: 오른드라스는 검을 회수한 후 참모에게 보내는 자세한 보고서를 작성한 후, 그들을 몰살하려고 했다. 그는 한 명을 제외한 나머지 전원을 살해했다. 그의 행동은 눈에 보이는 이유도 동기도 없었다. 그는 황금꽃 3층에서 마지막으로 목격되었다.\n"
"\n"
"에보니 블레이드를 회수해 와라. 오른드라스는 어떻게 되든 상관 없다. 왼쪽 눈 아래에 상처가 있는 던머를 찾아라."
