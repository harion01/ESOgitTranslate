"\nTranscribed by Relicmaster Glenadir"
"\n"
"\nThere once was an artist of great talent. Her eyes shined with worlds unseen, so magnificent and bright that beautiful Summerset paled in comparison. She tried to paint these vibrant scenes, but found common colors lacking. How could she bring her visions to life?"
"\n"
"\nIn this hour of desperation, a poor merchant knocked on her door. He was a scraggly old man, with no companion but the hound at his feet."
"\n"
"\n""Would you consider buying this paintbrush?"" the poor merchant asked. ""I see by your house that you're an artist. With this you'll be able to truly bring life into your work."""
"\n"
"\nIntrigued, the artist agreed to pay a meager sum for this paintbrush. It was rather large, with a white tip and black ivory handle. She was told it was called the Monochrome Paintbrush, but to not let the name fool her. And so the old merchant left with a satisfied smile on his face."
"\n"
"\nThe artist went to work at once, and before her eyes the impossible occurred. What had been mere paint just moments before became sparkling and shining, with depths yet unknown. It went beyond color and emotion, transcended anything she had seen before. Finally, finally, the colors matched those images she had long since had in her head."
"\n"
"\nBut, as she painted, a strange thing happened. First, the color began to fade from her lips, the tips of her fingers, the point of her nose. Her hair turned from a golden yellow to a faded white, her clothes lost their blue and purples and turned to shades of gray."
"\n"
"\nShe did not notice. She painted, and painted, and painted away. She was lost within the scene she was creating, and her body turned white, and black, and gray. Her eyes grew heavy, and heartbeats further and further apart, until suddenly she collapsed."
"\n"
"\nBefore her body was the most beautiful painting in all of Summerset. It's said to still hang to this day, though it was never seen in Nirn again."

"\n"
"\nUpon further inspection, we still are unsure of who gifted Narlindril the lute. He just turned twelve, and the celebration banquet had a great deal of guests and presents. I fear that we'll never found out, given my son's current state. Now I can see that it was most obviously a trap."
"\n"
"\nThe lute was beautiful, and Narlindril took to it right away. That very night he began to attempt the first song which came with the accompanying music book. At first I thought him merely diligent, but as the night wore on I grew tired of the noise. When I told him to cease, he refused to meet my eye and simply kept playing. No matter what I said, I couldn't get him to stop. Finally, I grabbed the lute from his hands, demanding he go to his room for the evening."
"\n"
"\nHe didn't say anything at first, but began to tremble. His entire body, shaking all at once. Then he fell to the ground in anguish, his limbs convulsing. He cried out, ""Mother! Please, give me the lute!"" his voice pained, as if he was being tortured."
"\n"
"\nOf course I gave him back the lute, fearful for my son's life. He hasn't stopped playing since, and we're reaching our third day. Our family's healers haven't left his side, but it pains me to see his fingers cut and bleed. He hasn't slept, he barely drinks and eats, and always he plays that cursed lute."

"\nMy husband will accompany Narlindril on his journey, and can answer any further questions you have. Please, if anything can be done, our family will owe you a great debt. No cost is too great for the life of our only son."
