msgid "King Torug, founder of the original city of Orsinium, possessed a powerful relic known as the Armlet of Torug. According to legend, the armlet is a magical bracelet encrusted with gems. With its power, Torug was able to tame the savage wilderness of Wrothgar and establish the first city of Orsinium.\n\nAncient text fragments describe the armlet, Torug's shrine, and something called ""Sorrow's Kiss."" Armed only with these hints, the famed explorer Lady Clarisse Laurent agreed to lead an expedition to the summit to find and retrieve the relic on behalf of the House of Orsimer Glories.\n\nAs with all items of historic significance, please remember not to touch anything in the museum."

Every caravan they try to bring into Wrothgar becomes a general store for my Winterborn—a store where we can take what we want and never worry about making a payment! Of course, the outsiders that Kurog summoned have been somewhat troublesome. In the end, it won't make a difference. We'll kill them as fast as they arrive!\n\nThe hagravens continue to perfect the process for growing briar hearts and using them to create briar-heart warriors. The tree is an impressive piece of magic, especially considering the hagravens thought of it. But I never turn down a good idea, no matter where it may originate. Thanks to the briar hearts, my warriors will never die. And that's why Urfon Ice-Heart will win this war. That's why the Winterborn will be victorious!"

msgid "An Informal Study\nBy Folms Seleth\n\nWhat is the fascination the typical Orc has with his (or her) own tusks? I swear, if they aren't constantly polishing or sharpening the damn things, they're studying them in whatever reflective surface is at hand or looking longingly at the tusks of their neighbors. And when they're not doing these things, they're talking about their tusks like they were royal heirlooms or ancient relics that were almost magical in nature. Let me tell you, it's enough to drive this Dark Elf a bit mad!\n\nWhile I supposed it would be rude to just come right out and ask an Orc about this obsession with all things tusk related, I decided that making a study of how the word and concept of the tusk was used in everyday Orc speech could help me reach some level of understanding. The first Orc I approached about the subject, a young female who I'll call ""Orcah,"" made an angry face—at least, I think it was angry; I find it difficult to tell the difference when it comes to the countenance of the average Orc—and told me in an angry voice to ""tusk off!""\n\nWhat an odd expression, I thought. ""Tusk off."" Simple, declarative. It means almost nothing, but as it emerged from Orcah's mouth, I knew exactly what she wanted me to do. I departed quickly, making my apologies in great haste even as she was reaching for the axe hanging at her side.\n\nThis got me to thinking about other Orcish expressions that contained the ubiquitous word. For example, ""By Malacath's tusk!"" This seems to be an all-purpose exclamation that substitutes the proper noun with any of a multitude of famous or infamous Orcs. I've heard Orcs swear by the tusks of Malacath, Trinimac, Kurog, Bazrag, Forge-Mother Alga, Urtho the Flatulent, and even hearth-mothers and ancient ancestors that no one but the Orc making the exclamation even remembers. And for variety, the forsworn tusks might be chipped, cracked, broken, missing, pierced, or any of a myriad of shades and colors. \n\nAnother expression I hear over and over in the Orsinium taverns, ""Better than a kick in the tusks,"" seems to imply that one unpleasant experience is somewhat less agreeable than another unpleasant experience. When one Orc says to another, ""I heard you fell into a pond full of leeches,"" her companion exclaims, ""Yeah, but it was better than a kick in the tusks,"" I can only conclude that no matter how horrible an ordeal an Orc suffers, there could always be something worse. I suppose that an Orc's tusks are extremely sensitive and a kick must instill in them unbearable pain. Or, it's just something to say and you can't really infer anything deeper from the conversation. Orcs can be so confusing.\n\nBut this is just the tip of the tusk, as it were. Spend a few hours in an Orc tavern and you'll hear all kinds of expressions involving tusks. ""Tusk you!"" ""Who gives a tusk?"" ""You tusking idiot!"" ""What the tusk?"" ""Stop tusking around!"" ""Tusk me!"" And perhaps my favorite, ""Go tusk yourself,"" which at first glance seems to be an impossible request, but I've seen what an Orc tusk can do to flesh and blood. An Orc must really dislike the person he or she offers this fierce suggestion to.\n\nI decided to make one more attempt to get an Orc to discuss the topic of tusks with me. This time I chose a striking young female who was seated by herself in a dark corner, making her way to the bottom of a bottle of Orsinium pink zinfandel. I asked if she'd be willing to talk about the many uses for the word ""tusk"" in the Orcish vocabulary. \n\n""Tusk no!"" she told me in no uncertain terms. Nevertheless, I pressed the issue. \n\n""Are you tusking kidding me?"" she asked. When I assured her I wasn't ""tusking kidding her,"" she balled up her fist and knocked me on my arse.\n\n""Tusk!"" I exclaimed. And I finally understood the true meaning of the word."

msgid "I received a rare invitation from the reclusive Morkul Clan. According to the master of their forge, I am the first outsider permitted to gaze upon the forge where they create their greatest works, deep beneath the Wrothgarian Mountains. In my first day alone I have witnessed many wonders of which I never thought Orcs to be capable. I decided to document my experience before I return to the College.\n\nI am struck by the secretive nature of these Orcs. Even the entrances to their great forge are carefully concealed, invisible if one does not know their presence. As if that were not enough, some paths only seem to open for those of their own bloodline, or perhaps those who prove themselves in some way. I shall have to inquire further.\n\nThe forge itself was breathtaking. I must admit, I had my doubts—these are Orcs, after all—but it is indeed a magnificent sight. I made no mention of it, but it was clear the forge was not created by the Orcs. True, they have done much work on the exterior to conceal its origins. But the inner workings, the meticulous design? There is Dwemer brilliance beneath the Orc stone. Of that, I have no doubts.\n\nThe Orcs boast proudly of the forge, and work it with a variety of implements, but say nothing of the forge-hammer itself. Do they even know what they have? The forge is special, true, and my senses are keen enough to recognize the Dwemer had good reason for constructing it here. Yet the forge-hammer is older, and stronger still. What such a tool could do in my hands instead of theirs!\n\nPerhaps an opportunity will arise. For now, the forge-master showed me to a side chamber for rest and drink. The heat from this place is sweltering and clouds the mind. More after my head clears."

Never forget that echatere is food, echatere is clothes. This is the first rule of the range.\n\nIf an Elf comes to your village and says the echatere is ""cute"" or ""noble""—punch him in the face. Echatere are not cute or noble, but ugly, mean, and pointy. If you fall in love with echatere, echatere kill you. This is the second rule of the range.\n\nYou cannot herd echatere without whistling. But whistling makes echatere angry. Still you must do it or you will not eat. We must all do things that could get us killed in order to not die. This is the third rule of the range.\n\nWhen you slaughter echatere, cut open its throat and catch the blood in a basin. Otherwise, it will rot from the inside. This is not a rule. This is just common sense. You do not want to eat rotten meat.\n\nIf you give a baby echatere a name, then your children will fall in love with it and they will cry when you kill it. So even though it is hard to tell all echatere apart and you want to give them names so that you can tell which is which, name them things like ""Dumb-Hamster-Crab"" and ""Possibly-Poisonous"" and ""Very-Stabby"" but do not give them Orc names or else your children will become soft and hate you for the rest of your life. \n\nThese are all the rules of the range. Follow them and your herd will prosper and your bellies will be full and your children will not hate you.\n\nADDENDUM: One echatere is an echatere. Two are echateres—everyone knows this.

They are very social creatures, with each Riekr expected to do his part. \n\nI have been assigned the task of smashing rocks with a hammer. I have yet to determine the purpose of this task, but that does not seem to trouble the other rock-breakers, who have taken to the task with gleeful cackling.\n\nDay 2\n\nMore rock-breaking. I fear I have pulled some kind of muscle in my forearm.\n\nDay 3\n\nFurther observation of the Riekr social structure reveals a strange attitude toward magic and its practitioners. Being creatures of limited intelligence, they lack the kind of formal training in magic that one sees in other parts of Tamriel. They make up for this through an innate connection to the magic of the world, so to speak.\n\nWhen a Riekr demonstrates a connection to magic, he is immediately shunned by his brothers. They throw stones, such as the ones we broke when I first joined the clan, to drive him off. The mage must then flee into the wilderness or face certain death. After a period of exile, the Riekr mage buys his way back into the clan with an offering of food, such as freshly slain deer, bear, or echatere.\n\nAfter that, the mage is elevated into a revered member of the clan, suddenly gaining power and influence with the Riekr chief.\n\nDay 5\n\nThe mages have gathered in a council and the signal has been given for a migration.

So great was the number of dead that the clans saw autumn's return twice over before all the bodies had been gathered.\n\nWhen they saw the number of the dead, and the fields that lay fallow with none to work them, the chiefs of clans Shar and Tuul met in secret. They said ""There is neither glory nor honor in the slaughter of our warriors. The hero that rises this season will die the next and when we are old and grey, will there be any strong Orc left to replace us?""\n\nSo they called on Malacath and made an offering of echatere and of their own blood. And the Prince answered them: \n\n""Erect a monument of the dead to me, a cairn for the fallen of clans Shar and Tuul. There pick from among your number the strongest. The contenders will duel atop the cairn until it is consecrated with the blood of the loser. The victor shall be chief of a new clan, Shar-tuul.""\n\nThe chiefs did as Malacath commanded. The war between the clans ended and a new clan was founded. The place of the first duel was called the Bloody Knoll, for it was built from the bodies of the war-slain and consecrated with the blood of the losing duelist."

msgid "I have been alone for so long. Alone, yet never alone, for I know She guides me in silken dreams.\n\nThe Elf nearly ruined us all. Or perhaps the folly was Skalg's. His hubris grew in recent years. He convinced himself he was the Spider's Champion. ""We need the Old Blood,"" he would say, ""the blood of Ehlnofey!"" He sought it with fervor.\n\nHe found our undoing. Skalg brought the mage here, alive and unbroken. He was a golden Elf, tall and proud and striking. I could see lust in his amber eyes. Not for me, likely not for any mortal flesh, but for something greater.\n\nSkalg gave him the drink we'd often used before. He planned to chain the Elf, to keep him alive as long as possible, a vessel of that most valuable blood.\n\nWe argued. This was not the Song I heard, nor the path I was to walk along Mephala's threads. But Skalg convinced me I could not see the intricacies of Her Web. And so I trusted.\n\nThe mage did not succumb, and his fury was great. Skalg burned to ash before I cried out. Not even the blood-forged guardians gave the Elf pause as he smote his way to the forge. He struck down Borz and took the hammer in his hands.\n\nHe produced a small fork from his robes, then tapped it against the hammer. Morkuldin bucked and shuddered. The walls cried out in protest. My clan died around me, blood pouring from their ears and eyes. The Elf's laughter drowned out their screams. But above it all I heard the Song.\n\nI approached the Elf from behind, no fear in my heart. I felt nothing but the faith as I gripped his silken hair and plunged his golden face into the forge flames.\n\nSilence. So much silence.\n\nI still hear Her in silken dreams. Her whispers tell me how to calm the forge, to make it slumber, to keep it hidden. My time here ends, and soon I will join Her atop the Spiral Skein.\n\nSomeday, another will hear her Song, even if they do not realize what drives them. On that day the forge will breathe again, and feast for the glory of the Silver Spider.\n\nIt is time. I shall give myself to her children, so they may feast and nest. My husk shall be a vessel for their offspring, a nurturing cocoon. I shall live on, peering out from endless eyes, and so shall I know Her glory."

msgid "Many will say we fled Orsinium because we were cowards. My children, it is a lie. When time is long gone and your own people have forgotten where they came from, do not hang your head in shame. Remember the story of Torug's folly, of Baloth's betrayal, and of Golkarr's tomb.\n\nThe Orcs are strong people, fierce and warlike. Blood is our birthright, and the sinews of Malacath knit around our bones. But we were not made to sit still. We were not made to settle and till the land, but to move, to pillage, and to plunder. Our strength is to destroy. We reap the glory of war from what we destroy. That is the only crop we need!\n\nBut many years ago, Torug, first among the Orcs in strength and rage, came to our people with a vision. We will build a great city, said he, and the rest of the world will look to us with fear and respect.\n\nFear us they did, but know that an Orc is never respected, no matter how great a city he builds.\n\nThey built the city into the rock, a shiny gem. Orsinium. And it was a great city, but Orcs were not made to live in cities. Its walls, designed to defend, only trapped us. Its threefold gates sealed us in. The city was a cairn to Torug's ambition—to the dreams of the Orcs, and in time the Redguard and Breton peoples came to destroy it.\n\nWe did not flee because we feared war. We fled to meet the enemy and we cut a swathe through their armies and then through their lands. All their holdings in Wrothgar trembled as we marched, and the earth shook with the sound of our footfalls.\n\nO Glory! O Joy! To be Orcs again! Free and on the move!\n\nIt was not to last. The enemy mustered their forces in number far exceeding our own and pressed us back to the edge of the mountain, to the plain of unending ice. In the shelter of the clockwork demons we found warmth and home and a defense against our enemies, until the time when we can emerge again triumphant and ride to victory under the light Malacath's tusky grin."

msgid "A Study of Death Rites of the People of Tamriel\nBy Chaplain Jorden, Priest of Arkay\n\nAs a devout follower of the god of burials and funeral rites, I have dedicated my life to the study of the ceremonies and rituals performed by the various races of Tamriel when it comes to the deaths of their leaders, family members, and loved ones. In this volume, I explore the death rites of the Orsimer—otherwise known as the Orcs of Wrothgar.\n\nPopular lore would have us believe that an Orc's remains lay where they fall. While there is a grain of truth in this concept, Orcs know as much about disease and decay as any of the other intelligent races. No one wants a rotting corpse left around to stink up the place, and rotting corpses attract all kinds of insects and predators. So, while the spot where an Orc dies is marked and considered almost sacred by his brethren, the body is not left in place for more than a few hours. During this time, friends and family come by to pay their last respects. Then the body is removed—to where, I cannot say.\n\nOrcs, for all their oral traditions, refuse to provide explanations or specifics to outsiders. I have had to make educated guesses based upon observations and the few conversations I've been able to engage in. But so far, no one will tell me what the Orcs do with the bodies of the dead.\n\n* * *\nI discovered an ancient Orcish burial site, the mountain known as Sorrow. This snow-covered peak, full of dangerous creatures and deadly weather, served as a depository for dead Orcs for several generations, though the practice ended abruptly sometime in the past. Apparently, the mountain was reserved for only the bravest and strongest Orcs, who were required to climb as high as they could before death finally overtook them. These Orcs were left where they fell, but stones were piled atop their bodies to form protective cairns or unique constructions called wedge tombs.\n\nThis also appears to have some connection to the practice of marking any location where an Orc dies and falls with a sacred rock. They call the rocks ""tumnors,"" which I believe means ""death stones"" in the Orcish tongue.\n\n* * *\nI finally found an old Orc female who was willing to share some of their death rituals with me. Specifically, she was willing to discuss the practice of ""beshkar-nor,"" the death-forge.\n\nApparently, what happens to the bodies of Orcs of great stature—leaders, heroes, and revered elders—is that they undergo a process known as the death-forge. The old Orc described the process in confusing terms. I'm not sure if the blood is drained from the body and saved for later use or if the entire body is burned and reduced to ash, and then the ash is saved. Either way, the saved remains wind up mixed into molten metal, allowing the revered Orc to become one with a powerful tool or weapon, usually a sword, hammer, or shield.\n\n* * *\nSo, my quest to completely understand the complex funerary rites practiced by the Orcs of Wrothgar continues. I've learned so much, but I realize I haven't really learned anything at all. I know, as a general rule, the Orcs don't bury their dead—except when they do, such as on the mountain of Sorrow. I know that they mark the place where a powerful Orc died, but they probably don't actually leave the body there to rot and decay. And I learned that some portion of a dead Orc is saved to mix with a newly forged tool or weapon in a process known as the death-forge.\n\nI'll continue to probe and investigate, for I find these contradictory practices to be fascinating. I just hope I don't anger the wrong Orc and learn about their death rituals first hand. That wouldn't do at all."

msgid "There is a creature in the land of the Orcs that defies explanation. The chub loon has no purpose and little known history. However, it is delicious when cooked with moon-sugar glaze and citrus.\n\nI, Zabia-ko, and several companions sought to secure trade with the Orcs of Fharun Stronghold when we found ourselves on the wrong side of the negotiations. We had little choice but to run for our lives when the chief burned our ship and sent warriors after us. The cold and rocky coast overlooking the frigid Sea of Ghosts became our home for the night. The howling sea wind bit deep into our fur. Despite that, sleep eventually came in the dark of the night.\n\nAs the sun rose over the Druadach Mountains, a cacophony of honking sounds broke the rhythmic peace of the waves against the rocks. The others feared some unknown beast had come to eat us, but curiosity overcame this one, and she slipped out of her bedroll, grabbed her staff, and moved toward the coast to let her eyes decide if we should stay or flee. Of all the creatures that have passed before Zabia-ko's eyes, none are stranger than the stub-legged, waddling birds that swarmed the ice floes and rocks. They stood in groups, clumping for warmth, with their useless wings flapping at their sides. Their call, once frightening, sounded comical when I looked upon them.\n\nThe birds were nothing like anything in the old and well-worn wilderness guide I borrowed from the library back home. Escape through the Friendship Gate could wait. This was something new, and new things have value. At first we were very careful to gather a few of the creatures, but we soon learned that they were too stupid to flee from a Khajiit. They had no trouble fleeing from Orcs, though! Any proper prey should try to run away when Khajiit walk among them, but not these flightless birds. We scooped them up and made haste for the gate, lest the Fharun clan catch our scent and give chase.\n\nThis one's first stop in Wayrest was to the Mages Guild. A few pieces of gold gained me access to their natural history library, where a new edition of the wilderness guide was prominently displayed. It mentions the chub loon as an elusive creature that was not observed by earlier writers. How could such an obnoxious creature be overlooked?\n\nThis one spent several days and candle-lit nights going over every tome on the creatures and wildlife of Tamriel. Not a single mention of the chub loon exists before the beginning of the second era. How could that be? The very first mention is in a text on the horker, and it only says that they were moving in on the horker habitat, disrupting the food source. Could it be that, like the Nords and other men, they came from another land? Could the stupid birds have been brought here by travelers from Atmora? Could they have traversed the Sea of Ghosts on their own with only floating chunks of ice to carry them? In any case, no matter how they arrived, they secured a new habitat, flourishing on Wrothgar's rocky coast."

Count Tamsin exclaimed. ""I'll chop him up and feed him to his own ducks, damn the man!""\n\nSuddenly Vale was pressed against the count, nothing but the thin silk sheet between them.

""I do believe the craving has returned.""\n\n""What about my game warden?""\n\n""Justice can wait, Tamsin,"" Vale whispered, ""but I do believe we were in the middle of something when the solution so rudely interrupted us. I'm quite famished, but I'm in the mood for something a bit more substantial than duck.""\n\n""Oh, Investigator Vale,"" the count said, as he and the sleuth fell back into the bed."

What you should be paying attention to is this half-empty bottle of wamasu bile.""\n\nAlchemist Krelana shifted nervously, glancing at the burly town guard who was watching their exchange with renewed interest. She swallowed and said,""What does my old supply room have to do with the death of Grath the Banker? He was locked in his own room when he died.""\n\nVale dragged a gloved finger across one of the shelves. ""Yes, the place is rather dusty. You did insist that this particular storage facility hadn't been used in many months. But notice the bottle of wamasu bile. Most of the dust has been wiped away.

He just didn't realize it!""\n\nVale turned to the alchemist with a triumphant grin. ""Admit it. You applied generous amounts of the deadly bile to the banker's quill during these past few weeks. You slowly poisoned the poor man!""\n\n""Damn you, Vale!"" the alchemist spat. ""But I won't let you have the satisfaction of watching them cart me off to a dungeon!"" Krelana poured the contents of a vial down her throat before the guard could stop her. Her skin turned the color of ash even before she slumped to the ground.\n\n""Your death gives me no satisfaction, Krelana,"" Vale said with regret. Then she perked up. ""But your scullery maid, on the other hand … now where did that little vixen run off to?"""

The culprit is, in fact, Palwin the blacksmith!""\n\nInvestigator Vale's words echoed off the walls as the crowd gathered in the library around Lady Mandrake gasped. Heads turned in all directions, seeking the accused. In the back of the room, the blacksmith stood nervously. A look of utter guilt spread across his face even as he shook his head from side to side.\n\n""What are you talking about? There was no way a mere mortal could have caused all this trouble,"" he said defensively. ""How could I sneak into a locked room and murder the butler? How could I hide the body when I was in my forge the entire time? You have no evidence, wench!""\n\nThe room fell silent as all eyes once again turned to Investigator Vale. The insult didn't seem to faze her in the least. Her eyes sparkled in the flickering candlelight as she drew back her shoulders and tilted her chin up slightly so that her raven hair fell across her back. The fingers of her right hand, curled into a tight fist, seemed to clutch something. She made a deliberate show of rotating her fist and letting her fingers fall open to reveal a shiny bronze key in the shape of a skull.\n\n""Oh, you have once again underestimated me, dear Palwin,"" Vale said. ""The evidence is clear as the nose on your face. You were the only one who had access to this skeleton key, the one lost by the lord of Mandrake Manor!""\n\nPalwin's eyes widened. He stumbled over his words before collecting himself, Then he said, ""You … you don't know that was mine. How did you even get it? I … wait. You used me!""\n\nVale's head rolled back as a joyous laugh erupted from her long, elegant throat. ""Oh, you silly little man! Of course I used you! Those drinks we shared last night? I added a tincture to yours that allowed me to search your rooms after you fell into a deep sleep. It was then a simple matter for me to see exactly what was out of place.""\n\nVale, now moving about the room and playing to her audience, continued. ""Scratches on the floor by the bookshelf clearly revealed evidence of a hidden door. Gloves casually tossed in a corner, stained with blood. Boots caked with grass from the forest where the bodies were found. And this key, sitting on your nightstand for anyone to see.""\n\n""What does any of that prove, except that you drugged me?""

Tunnels that could only be accessed with this key. What started as a scheme to frighten and blackmail the lord—shame on you for that!—eventually led to murder.""\n\n""No!"" Palwin screamed. ""I won't be cheated out of what's mine! Not again!"" He drew a dagger from his belt and rushed toward Vale. She stepped to the side at the last possible moment, sending Palwin off balance and head-long into the wall. He fell, his own dagger protruding from his chest.\n\n""Murder never pays,"" Vale said. ""Now if you'll excuse me, I have a bottle of aqua vitae waiting for me. And another mystery. There's always another mystery."""

msgid "Gull-koo loves her briar hearts! She's an interesting old bird, that hagraven. Since coming to the old Breton fort, my job among the Winterborn has been to assist Gull-koo, doing whatever the hagraven needs in order to make sure the briar hearts grow and thrive. Strange things, those briar hearts. Kind of like large fruits, but also kind of like the heart of some large animal. Or man.\n\nToday I got to see the process up close. It starts with a corpse. The Winterborn prefer to use the corpse of an enemy, but the hagravens have no such compunctions, Any corpse will serve their purposes, whether an Orc, Winterborn, or even a harpy. Once a corpse is procured, it is purified in a strange ritual of the hagraven's own devising and place in a specially prepared plot of soil. Then, with great reverence and fanfare, the hagraven adds the briar heart seed to the planted body.\n\nSpells and blood serve to feed and water the macabre garden, and soon the first sprouts begin to bloom from the corpse. The sprouts quickly grow into saplings, which in turn grow into small trees. These small trees connect through a system of roots back to the large tree the hagravens and tree tenders care for in one of the fort's courtyards. I believe that the sapling trees contribute to the health and overall power of the large tree, but my questions on the subject were ignored by Gull-koo and the other hagravens.\n\nMeanwhile, briar heart fruit blooms on the saplings and the large tree alike, beating a haunting cascade that echoes throughout the fortress. Once the fruit ripens, it is ready to be transplanted. And that's where our own warriors come into the picture. In most cases, when a Winterborn warrior falls in battle, a hagraven can bless the warrior with a ripe briar heart. The magical process plunges the briar heart into the fallen warrior and returns the warrior to life, granting him or her additional strength and fortitude as befits a briar-heart warrior.\n\nNow, I haven't yet been privy to the process, but I believe there's also a way to implant the briar hearts into living warriors. I've seen the cages where some of our most-powerful and loyal warriors have gone to meditate and prepare themselves for elevation to briar-heart warrior status. Perhaps, if Gull-koo agrees, they'll allow me to accept such an honor. I'll let you know how it turns out.\n\nYour sister, writing from Frostbreak Fortress"

That work, ""Ogres: A Summary,"" should contain sufficient information for those interested in learning more about the dumb brutes, but I write this addendum in an effort to clear up some misconceptions I've heard since traveling to Wrothgar.\n\nFirst, do not let anyone tell you that these beasts have any sort of ""societal structure."" As with other animals, stronger ogres ""lead"" weaker ogres by proving their dominance. Simple, uncomplicated.\n\nSecond, ogres cannot work magic. There have been reports of ""ogre shamans"" but these are the gross exaggerations of the misinformed. Some few ogres may have capabilities that are hard to explain, but we shall see they are no more complicated than a spider's ability to spin a web.\n\nFinally, unlike the graceful senche or the useful guar, these beasts have no redeeming qualities. They cannot be trained, taught, or domesticated. It would be better to treat them as we would any other natural hazard and work around them or remove them from our proximity. There is no better response."

I listened to my clan chief. I tried to live by the Grudge and the Broken Promise. And then I had a revelation. I heard the word of Trinimac and my life was completely changed.\n\nSo what happened? I was on my way to visit the city of Orsinium, taking a barrel of my clan's famous tree-stump ale to trade, when I was bodily assaulted by a gang of Vosh Rakh recruiters. Praise Trinimac's name! They wrestled me to the ground, pulled a sack over my head, and took me to some secret location. I don't mind admitting I was scared for my life!\n\nAfter what seemed like hours, one of the Vosh Rakh elders removed my hood. She said that she was going to show me the error of my old-fashioned thinking. That she was going to open my mind and make me more receptive to Trinimac's holy message. I won't go into too many details, but I will say that her methods included frequent beatings, endless repetition of key phrases, threats against my family, and a judicious amount of a vile-tasting beverage that she explained would help me better understand the words of Trinimac.\n\nWhen I finally relented and declared my devotion to Trinimac and the Vosh Rakh, the process only continued for another hour before the elder was convinced of my sincerity. Then I was given my mask and robes and welcomed into the fellowship of the Vosh Rakh. Praise Trinimac!\n\nNow? Now I'm a loyal member of the fellowship, one of Trinimac's sharp blades. I fight for the Vosh Rakh. I will die for the Vosh Rakh, if they ask me to. But here's a little secret—I don't want to be a Vosh Rakh! As far as I can tell, most of the recent converts don't want to be part of the group. We just can't help ourselves. The recruitment drive is that good."

msgid "A Discourse on Faith by Ugdorga, the King's Scribe\n\nFor generations, Orcs have believed in three constant truths: the stronghold, the grudge, and the fury of Malacath. But before Malacath, at least according to certain traditions and a few noted scholars, there was Trinimac. Today, the city of Orsinium reverberates with the intellectual debate and reverent faith of both sides of the argument: Who is the true god of the Orcs?\n\nFor traditionalists, there is no question. Malacath is lord and god. He personifies the Sworn Oath and the Bloody Curse. His portfolio includes conflict, battle, broken promises, and anguish. Everything an Orc feels concerning his or her place in the world comes from the Furious One. The Orcs see themselves as a people betrayed, and Malacath reinforces this belief. For Malacath, clans must stand powerful but alone in their ancestral strongholds. The strongest rules and weakness is cast out with extreme intolerance.\n\nClan chiefs such as Chief Bazrag, who oppose the idea of an Orsimer king, hold to the teachings of Malacath.\n\nFor the new Orsimer, Trinimac is the culmination of their dreams and desires. The warrior god personifies culture and civilization. He calls for unity, not discord; for strength, not malicious chaos. He stands for unifying the Orsimer. For elevating us above our baser nature and making us equal to the other races.\n\nKing Kurog and the Orsimer of Orsinium follow the teachings of Trinimac."
